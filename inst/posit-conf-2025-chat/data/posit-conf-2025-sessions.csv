**Location:** Greenbriar

**Session Info:**  
In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.  
  
In both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally. In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.  
  
This workshop is for you if you:  
know how to fit a linear regression model in R,  
have a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and  
are interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships."

Data insights won’t speak for themselves.  
  
For the past five years, Articulation has been coaching all of the breakout session, keynote, and lightning talk speakers at posit::conf. We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  
  
This workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  
  
The Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  
What you’ll learn:  
What data to gather about your audience  
A formula for setting the necessary context  
A formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  
Strategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  
Strategies for laddering complex insights  
Who it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  
  
About Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers.

**Location:** International South

**Session Info:**  
The deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research. This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  
  
Our session will address the following key questions and themes:  
Actionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  
Industry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  
Selecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  
Pharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  
Does this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  
Compliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  
Provisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  
  
The workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  
  
Join us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  
  
Target Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments."

Package Development: The Rest of the Owl,"## Session Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl

**Speakers:** 
Jenny Bryan , Software engineer, Posit

**Time:** Tuesday, Sep 169:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  
**Location:** Hanover C

**Session Info:**  
In R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data. Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  
  
This workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of ""How to draw an owl"", you've definitely drawn some circles.  
  
But now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  
  
You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  
  
This list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  
Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  
Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  
Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. ""later"")  
Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  
Data: internal data vs. data available to your user  
GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  
User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  
There will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  
We will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  
But if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  
  
This will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  
  
This course is for you if you:  
Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  
Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  
Have concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  
Are interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  
Are at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  
We expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  
We typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  
Participants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.

Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python,"## Session Title: Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python

**Speakers:** 
Joe Cheng , Posit  
  
Garrick Aden-Buie , Posit

**Time:** Tuesday, Sep 169:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  
**Location:** Regency VI

**Session Info:**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) open up a world of programmatic possibilities, giving developers easy access to capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago. But for many, the idea of integrating LLM APIs into their workflows feels daunting. This workshop is here to show you otherwise.  
  
We’ll introduce you to elmer (R) and chatlas (Python), two user-friendly packages developed by Posit that make calling LLMs from code surprisingly straightforward. These tools handle the complexities of conversation history, tool calling, vision support, and more, so you can focus on experimentation and creativity. They also integrate nicely with Shiny for R and Python, where you can easily create chat interfaces or build custom web apps around LLM workflows.  
  
Along the way, we’ll explore system prompt design, token management, tool calling, and structured output, all while building familiarity with the various models and vendors that are shaping the AI landscape today.  
  
You’ll discover that:  
Calling LLMs from code unlocks new possibilities that go far beyond what’s achievable with off-the-shelf tools like ChatGPT.  
It’s easier than you think—no advanced AI background required.  
It’s incredibly fun and rewarding to bring your own ideas to life.  
This workshop is perfect for those curious about AI but unsure where to start, as well as for seasoned developers looking to learn about Posit’s new tools. We’ll also touch on more advanced topics like fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You’ll get hands-on experience with guided projects or with the flexibility to explore using your own projects.  
  
If you’ve been sitting on the fence, wondering whether LLMs are worth diving into, this workshop will give you the hands-on experience and confidence you need to get started.

R in Production,"## Session Title: R in Production

**Speakers:** 
Hadley Wickham , Posit

**Time:** Tuesday, Sep 169:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  
**Location:** Centennial I

**Session Info:**  
What it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization. However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  
  
This workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  
Not just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  
Not just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  
Not just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  
  
This course is for you if you:  
Get frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  
Struggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  
Want to improve the quality of your production code generally.

**Location:** Embassy C

**Session Info:**  
Shiny is a framework for building web applications and data dashboards in Python. In this one-day intermediary workshop, you will see how the basic building blocks of Shiny can be extended to create your own scalable, production-ready Python applications.  
  
In particular, this workshop covers:  
Overview of the basic building blocks of a Shiny for Python application  
How to refactor applications into shiny modules  
How to write tests for your shiny application  
  
At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:  
Build a Shiny app in Python  
Refactor your reactive logic into Shiny Modules  
Identify when to write Shiny modules  
Write unit tests and end-to-end tests for your shiny application  
  
1. What if I'm a complete beginner?  
  
You should have a basic understanding of Python and be able to install packages with pip, do basic data manipulation, and draw plots.  
  
2. What if I've never built a Shiny app before?  
  
This workshop doesn’t require any Shiny or web application experience. We'll focus more on practical examples in the course. We do have additional resources for you to dive more into more Shiny details, but we will cover the basics needed to build larger and scalable applications.  
  
3. Why should I learn Shiny if I already know Streamlit or Dash?  
  
We believe that Shiny is the best framework for building data applications in Python. Its reactive execution model means that you can build performant applications without explicitly caching data or managing the application state. Seethis blog postfor more on why we think that Shiny is worth learning.  
  
4. I’m an expert with Shiny for R, is this workshop for me?  
  
The R and Python Shiny packages are similar, so some of the content in this workshop may be familiar to you. That said, it’s a great opportunity to fill in missing pieces and ask questions about Python best practices. We will also talk about Shiny modules and testing in this workshop, which will also be a precursor for you to learn more about Python Packaging. If you are interested in learning more about Python, this workshop would be a great practical way to learn how to code in Python.
