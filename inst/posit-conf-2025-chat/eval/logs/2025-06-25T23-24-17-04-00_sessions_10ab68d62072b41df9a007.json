As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems. He created the Python pandas and Ibis projects, co-created Apache Arrow, and co-founded Voltron Data.

JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.\n<br><br>\nUnderstanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit. By the end of the session, you'll have a clear framework for choosing the right IDE for your data science and analytics tasks.\n\n**Speaker name:** Isabel Zimmerman\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.isabelizimm.me/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\" target=\"_blank\">Isabel Zimmerman<\/a><\/u><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\">(she/her) is a software engineer at Posit, PBC.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems. He created the Python pandas and Ibis projects, co-created Apache Arrow, and co-founded Voltron Data. He is a Member of the Apache Software Foundation and also a project PMC member for Apache Parquet. He is currently a Principal Architect at Posit PBC where he works on Positron and other Python-related initiatives.\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science. Finding your groove in a new IDE takes time, so we’ve got some tips and tricks to help you feel more at home in Positron!\n<br><br>\nWe’ll cover key navigation concepts, helpful features for different workflows, and configuration settings for a pleasant IDE experience. Plus, we’ll show you how to explore what Positron is doing under the hood – so you can understand it more deeply and solve problems with confidence.\n<br><br>\nWhether you’re just getting started or already using Positron, these tips will help you settle into your data science workflow and get the most out of everything Positron has to offer.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Oldham Barca\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC.\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science.

JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.\n<br><br>\nUnderstanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems.

JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.\n<br><br>\nUnderstanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit. By the end of the session, you'll have a clear framework for choosing the right IDE for your data science and analytics tasks.\n\n**Speaker name:** Isabel Zimmerman\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.isabelizimm.me/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\" target=\"_blank\">Isabel Zimmerman<\/a><\/u><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\">(she/her) is a software engineer at Posit, PBC.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems. He created the Python pandas and Ibis projects, co-created Apache Arrow, and co-founded Voltron Data. He is a Member of the Apache Software Foundation and also a project PMC member for Apache Parquet. He is currently a Principal Architect at Posit PBC where he works on Positron and other Python-related initiatives.\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science. Finding your groove in a new IDE takes time, so we’ve got some tips and tricks to help you feel more at home in Positron!\n<br><br>\nWe’ll cover key navigation concepts, helpful features for different workflows, and configuration settings for a pleasant IDE experience. Plus, we’ll show you how to explore what Positron is doing under the hood – so you can understand it more deeply and solve problems with confidence.\n<br><br>\nWhether you’re just getting started or already using Positron, these tips will help you settle into your data science workflow and get the most out of everything Positron has to offer.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Oldham Barca\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC.\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science.

JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.\n<br><br>\nUnderstanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit. By the end of the session, you'll have a clear framework for choosing the right IDE for your data science and analytics tasks.\n\n**Speaker name:** Isabel Zimmerman\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.isabelizimm.me/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\" target=\"_blank\">Isabel Zimmerman<\/a><\/u><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\">(she/her) is a software engineer at Posit, PBC.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all. \n<br><br>\nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you. \n<br><br>\nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.\n<br>\nWhat you’ll learn:\n<ul>\n<li> What data to gather about your audience <\/li>\n<li> A formula for setting the necessary context <\/li>\n<li> A formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement <\/li>\n<li> Strategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor <\/li>\n<li> Strategies for laddering complex insights <\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication. \n<br>\n<br>\nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  \nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  \nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  \n  \nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  \nWe expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  \nWe typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  \nParticipants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  \nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  \nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  \n  \nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  \nWe expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  \nWe typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  \nParticipants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment.

How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization. However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.\n<br><br>\nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:\n<ul>\n<li> Not just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?<\/li>\n<li> Not just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.<\/li>\n<li> Not just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  \nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  \nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  \n  \nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  \nWe expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  \nWe typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  \nParticipants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  \nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  \nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  \n  \nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  \nWe expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  \nWe typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  \nParticipants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.  \n  \nThis workshop is for you if you:  \nknow how to fit a linear regression model in R,  \nhave a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and  \nare interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Causal Inference in R\n**Code:** WS-013\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.\n<br> <br>\nIn both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n",

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers. Our clients come from Fortune 500 companies, internationally recognized education and research institutions, philanthropic organizations, and entrepreneurs eager to grow their businesses.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers.

In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.  \n  \nThis workshop is for you if you:  \nknow how to fit a linear regression model in R,  \nhave a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and  \nare interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Causal Inference in R\n**Code:** WS-013\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.\n<br> <br>\nIn both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.).

They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025.

When she’s not working with data, you can find her hiking, climbing, or making pottery.\n\n## Title: AskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBlockers to crucial data-driven decisions can often be a challenge.  To address this, we established RADS, the Regeneron Analysts and Data Scientists, as a Community of Practice for exchanging strategies on eliminating these obstacles. RADS has grown to nearly 500 members, creating a new challenge: avoiding redundancy and helping non-RADS colleagues find the right experts. To solve this, we developed AskRADS, an AI agent on Posit Connect that provides recommendations based on discussions, experts, and relevant resources. It uses R, Shiny for Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Neo4j GraphRAG, and MySQL. This talk will cover its architecture, AI search solutions, and optimization techniques.\n\n**Speaker name:** Regis A. James\n**Job title:** Associate Director of AI Data Science, Strategist, and Community of Practice Leader\n**Company:** Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\n**Bio:**\nI build AI systems that we teach to make data-driven decision recommendations for humans.\n\nAt Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a world-class developer of therapeutic biologics, I work as a full-stack data scientist to make medicine and optimize clinical trial logistics by collaborating with colleagues to bring structure to and extract meaning from biological data, helping illuminate nonobvious underlying relationships.  I also created and lead a vibrant data science community of practice, comprising hundreds of my colleagues across the company.\n\n## Title: Is that LLM feature any good?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe ellmer package has enabled R users to build all sorts of powerful LLM-enabled tools. How do you test these features, though? How do you know whether a change to your prompt made any difference, or if a much cheaper model would work just as well for your users? This talk introduces an R port of Inspect, a Python framework for LLM evaluation that has been widely adopted by both LLM developers and tool builders. Attendees will learn about the process of—and importance of—evaluating LLM-enabled apps empirically.\n\n**Speaker name:** Simon P. Couch\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nSimon Couch is a software engineer at Posit PBC where he works on open source statistical software. With an academic background in statistics and sociology, Simon believes that principled tooling has a profound impact on our ability to think rigorously about data. He authors and maintains a number of R packages and blogs about the process at simonpcouch.com. \n\n## Title: Trust, but Verify: Lessons from Deploying LLMs in a Large Health System\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nLarge language models (LLMs) are transforming how data practitioners work with unstructured text data. However, in high-stakes domains like medicine, we need to ensure that “hallucinated” clinical details don’t mislead clinicians. \n<br><br>\nThis talk will present a framework for evaluating and monitoring LLM systems, drawing from a real-world deployment at Stanford Health Care. We will describe how we built and assessed an LLM-powered system for real-time, automated chart abstraction within patients’ electronic health records, focusing on methods for measuring accuracy, consistency, and safety. Additionally, we will discuss how open-source tools like Chatlas and Quarto powered the work across our team’s combined Python- and R-based workflows.\n\n**Speaker name:** Timothy Keyes\n**Job title:** Data Scientist\n**Company:** Stanford Health Care\n**Bio:**\nTimothy Keyes is a Data Scientist at Stanford Health Care, where he deploys large language models in clinical workflows and builds systems to track their real-world performance.

First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claus Wilke\n**Job title:** Professor\n**Company:** The University of Texas at Austin\n**Bio:**\nClaus Wilke is a computational biologist and data scientist at The University of Texas at Austin, running a research lab that studies protein and peptide biochemistry. Claus is also the author of the book \"Fundamentals of Data Visualization,\" and he teaches data visualization at The University of Texas, both at the undergraduate and at the graduate level. He is an avid user of and regular contributor to the R ecosystem. He has authored several popular R packages used for data visualization, such as cowplot, ggridges, and ggtext.\n\n## Title: ChalkTalk: Globalizing Data Science Education with AI-generated Videos\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWe present ChalkTalk, an open-source tool that converts Quarto documents into engaging educational videos with AI-powered voices and avatars. By adding simple text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-video (TTV) attributes to markdown files, educators can automatically generate multilingual video content while maintaining the reproducibility benefits of Quarto. At The GRAPH Courses, where we've trained over 3,000 learners globally, we are testing out this tool to scale our video content creation. We'll demonstrate its integration with Quarto and present preliminary findings from our A/B testing with students.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kenechukwu Nwosu\n**Job title:** Curriculum Director\n**Company:** TheGraphCourses.org\n**Bio:**\n[Kene David Nwosu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kene-david-nwosu/) is an epidemiologist (PhDc) at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, and curriculum director of [The GRAPH Courses](https://thegraphcourses.org), a WHO-supported non-profit providing open-source R and Python training to health and life-science professionals across 50+ countries. Originally from Nigeria, Kene is passionate about expanding global access to data and AI literacy. With GRAPH , he is developing [ChalkTalk](https://github.com/the-graph-courses/chalktalk), an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert textbooks, papers, and plain-text lessons into adaptive, multilingual teaching videos for personalized learning at scale.\n\n## Title: Empowering Learners with WebR, Pyodide, and Quarto\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWebR, Pyodide, and Quarto are powerful technologies that let you run code exercises in the Web browser. Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p><a href=\"http://mine-cr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<\/strong><\/a> (she/her) is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit.

James , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  \n  \nSimon P. Couch , Software Engineer, Posit, PBC  \n  \nTimothy Keyes , Data Scientist, Stanford Health Care\n\n**Time:** Wednesday, Sep 1710:20 AM - 11:40 AM EDT  \n**Location:** Regency VI\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThere are 4 talks in this session.  \n  \nAI Coding Assistants: Hype, Help, or Hindrance?  \nAskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations  \nIs that LLM feature any good?  \nTrust, but Verify: Lessons from Deploying LLMs in a Large Health System  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: AI Coding Assistants: Hype, Help, or Hindrance?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nAI coding assistants like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Codeium promise to revolutionize our coding workflows—but how useful are they in practice? Are they our new overlords here to take our jobs? Or just a passing gimmick? I think the reality lies somewhere in between, and that understanding these tools is key to staying relevant in today’s rapidly evolving data science ecosystem.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll show how I’ve used these AI tools in RStudio, Positron, and VS Code to speed up both my advanced R workflows as well as my learning experience as an intermediate Python programmer, providing examples, pitfalls, and best practices.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rebecca Barter\n**Job title:** Research Assistant Professor\n**Company:** University of Utah\n**Bio:**\nRebecca is a data scientist and educator with a passion for teaching data science and uncovering the hidden patterns in healthcare data. Originally from Australia, Rebecca received her PhD in Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2019, during which time she co-authored a book and shared many helpful tips and resources on her blog, www.rebeccabarter.com. When she’s not working with data, you can find her hiking, climbing, or making pottery.\n\n## Title: AskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBlockers to crucial data-driven decisions can often be a challenge.  To address this, we established RADS, the Regeneron Analysts and Data Scientists, as a Community of Practice for exchanging strategies on eliminating these obstacles. RADS has grown to nearly 500 members, creating a new challenge: avoiding redundancy and helping non-RADS colleagues find the right experts. To solve this, we developed AskRADS, an AI agent on Posit Connect that provides recommendations based on discussions, experts, and relevant resources. It uses R, Shiny for Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Neo4j GraphRAG, and MySQL. This talk will cover its architecture, AI search solutions, and optimization techniques.\n\n**Speaker name:** Regis A. James\n**Job title:** Associate Director of AI Data Science, Strategist, and Community of Practice Leader\n**Company:** Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\n**Bio:**\nI build AI systems that we teach to make data-driven decision recommendations for humans.\n\nAt Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a world-class developer of therapeutic biologics, I work as a full-stack data scientist to make medicine and optimize clinical trial logistics by collaborating with colleagues to bring structure to and extract meaning from biological data, helping illuminate nonobvious underlying relationships.  I also created and lead a vibrant data science community of practice, comprising hundreds of my colleagues across the company.\n\n## Title: Is that LLM feature any good?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe ellmer package has enabled R users to build all sorts of powerful LLM-enabled tools. How do you test these features, though? How do you know whether a change to your prompt made any difference, or if a much cheaper model would work just as well for your users? This talk introduces an R port of Inspect, a Python framework for LLM evaluation that has been widely adopted by both LLM developers and tool builders. Attendees will learn about the process of—and importance of—evaluating LLM-enabled apps empirically.\n\n**Speaker name:** Simon P. Couch\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nSimon Couch is a software engineer at Posit PBC where he works on open source statistical software. With an academic background in statistics and sociology, Simon believes that principled tooling has a profound impact on our ability to think rigorously about data. He authors and maintains a number of R packages and blogs about the process at simonpcouch.com. \n\n## Title: Trust, but Verify: Lessons from Deploying LLMs in a Large Health System\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nLarge language models (LLMs) are transforming how data practitioners work with unstructured text data. However, in high-stakes domains like medicine, we need to ensure that “hallucinated” clinical details don’t mislead clinicians. \n<br><br>\nThis talk will present a framework for evaluating and monitoring LLM systems, drawing from a real-world deployment at Stanford Health Care. We will describe how we built and assessed an LLM-powered system for real-time, automated chart abstraction within patients’ electronic health records, focusing on methods for measuring accuracy, consistency, and safety.

First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claus Wilke\n**Job title:** Professor\n**Company:** The University of Texas at Austin\n**Bio:**\nClaus Wilke is a computational biologist and data scientist at The University of Texas at Austin, running a research lab that studies protein and peptide biochemistry.

This workshop is here to show you otherwise.  \n  \nWe’ll introduce you to elmer (R) and chatlas (Python), two user-friendly packages developed by Posit that make calling LLMs from code surprisingly straightforward. These tools handle the complexities of conversation history, tool calling, vision support, and more, so you can focus on experimentation and creativity. They also integrate nicely with Shiny for R and Python, where you can easily create chat interfaces or build custom web apps around LLM workflows.  \n  \nAlong the way, we’ll explore system prompt design, token management, tool calling, and structured output, all while building familiarity with the various models and vendors that are shaping the AI landscape today.  \n  \nYou’ll discover that:  \nCalling LLMs from code unlocks new possibilities that go far beyond what’s achievable with off-the-shelf tools like ChatGPT.  \nIt’s easier than you think—no advanced AI background required.  \nIt’s incredibly fun and rewarding to bring your own ideas to life.  \nThis workshop is perfect for those curious about AI but unsure where to start, as well as for seasoned developers looking to learn about Posit’s new tools. We’ll also touch on more advanced topics like fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You’ll get hands-on experience with guided projects or with the flexibility to explore using your own projects.  \n  \nIf you’ve been sitting on the fence, wondering whether LLMs are worth diving into, this workshop will give you the hands-on experience and confidence you need to get started.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python\n**Code:** WS-003\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) open up a world of programmatic possibilities, giving developers easy access to capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago.

Enter EcoCommons, a cutting-edge platform built on an R package that’s scientifically rigorous and designed for scale. EcoCommons efficiently runs millions of models to help researchers, governments, and NGOs make data-driven decisions. Whether it's predicting habitat loss, optimising conservation strategies, or advising policy, this platform turns R into a powerhouse for real-world impact—all while building a thriving community of practice. In this talk, we’ll explore the challenges of running R at scale, lessons learned, and how our community is shaping the future of modelling.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jenna Wraith\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Precision Medicine for All: Using Tidymodels to Validate PRS in Brazil\n**Code:** PAR-013\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPolygenic risk scores (PRS) are a powerful way to measure someone’s risk for common diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, most PRS are developed using data from European populations, making it challenging to generalize results to other ancestries. In this talk, I’ll show how I used tidymodels tools—like yardstick, recipes, and workflows—to calculate metrics and validate a breast cancer PRS in the highly admixed Brazilian population. You will learn how to leverage tidymodels to make precision medicine more inclusive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Flávia E.

This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n",

The Idaho Secretary of State’s office leveraged R and Quarto to create a better ENR product for the end user while driving down costs using the open-source software we all know and love. With help from Dr. Andrew Heiss, R was used in every step of the process—from {dbplyr} backend to visualizing the results using {reactable} tables and {leaflet} maps, combining the output into a visually appealing Quarto website. Quarto was the ideal solution due to its scalability, quick deployment, responsive design, and easy navigation. In addition, Dr. Heiss will discuss the advantages of using a {targets} pipeline and creating programmatic code chunks in Quarto.\n\n**Speaker name:** Andrew Heiss\n**Job title:** Assistant professor\n**Company:** Georgia State University\n**Bio:**\nAndrew Heiss is an assistant professor at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University.

Du Bois’s 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools. We split into two groups—one using R and the other Python—to compare their strengths and limitations. Both teams used census and geographic data to map county-level populations for 1870 and 1880. Team R used ggplot2 and grid for precise layout control, while Team Python used matplotlib’s subplot system for structuring. This challenge pushed us beyond more traditional data science visualizations, requiring creative approaches to mimic Du Bois’s design. Attendees will gain insights into data wrangling, visualization techniques, and layout design to guide their own projects.\n\n**Speaker name:** Olivia Hebner\n**Job title:** Data Science Manager\n**Company:** Summit Consulting\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Data for Real-World Impact\n\n**Speakers:** \nKylie Ainslie , Senior Researcher, Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)  \n  \nMarcus Beck , Senior Scientist, Tampa Bay Estuary Program  \n  \nMax Hockstein , Physician, MedStar Health  \n  \nGabe Osterhout , Data Visualization Specialist, Idaho Secretary of State  \n  \nAndrew Heiss , Assistant professor, Georgia State University\n\n**Time:** Thursday, Sep 1810:20 AM - 11:40 AM EDT  \n**Location:** Centennial I\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThere are 4 talks in this session.  \n  \nElevating Public Health Decision-Making with R Packages  \nData 911: how Posit can support decision-makers in times of environmental crisis  \nSee if talking to the doctor is right for you.  \nElection Night Reporting Using R & Quarto  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Elevating Public Health Decision-Making with R Packages\n**Code:** PAR-004\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSupporting public health decisions in high-stakes environments requires transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website.

Many developers struggle to implement proper testing due to time constraints and technical barriers. To address this challenge, we're introducing an innovative solution that automatically generates regression tests for existing Shiny apps. By leveraging AI models trained on testing best practices, the Shiny package will streamline the testing process, making it more accessible and efficient for developers of all skill levels.\n\n**Speaker name:** Karan Gathani\n**Job title:** Software QA Engineer\n**Company:** Posit PBC\n**Bio:**\nKaran is currently a Shiny Software QA Engineer at Posit. Karan has a history of working with tech startups in the San Francisco Bay Area helping them ship products efficiently without compromising on quality. In his spare time, he likes to participate in BioBlitzes organized around the Bay Area and contributing to this natural history blog.\n\n## Title: Playing nice with ecosystems: cross-platform anywidgets for interactive computing\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nanywidget is a specification and toolkit for authoring reusable interactive widgets, bridging modern web technologies with Python. It defines a standard for interactive elements that work across Jupyter, VS Code, Positron IDE, and web frameworks like Shiny for Python and Solara. While many platforms integrate anywidget through a Jupyter-compatibility layer, others have adopted it natively, extending its reach beyond Jupyter. This decoupling has also enabled early experiments with non-Python runtimes like R and Deno. By prioritizing flexibility and interoperability, anywidget helps library developers make their tools more widely usable and enables framework authors to bootstrap rich interactive ecosystems without platform lock-in.\n\n**Speaker name:** Trevor Manz\n**Job title:** Engineer\n**Company:** marimo\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Teaching Shiny Assistant Kung-Fu\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nTeaching an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to utilize a newly developed Python package is nearly impossible without access to the system prompt. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but they lack the knowledge to interact seamlessly with new, untrained packages. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how Shiny Assistant automatically enhances its system prompt based on the required Python packages for the user’s Shiny Application. This generated prompt leverages the packages’ existing documentation and computed strong types.

At The GRAPH Courses, where we've trained over 3,000 learners globally, we are testing out this tool to scale our video content creation. We'll demonstrate its integration with Quarto and present preliminary findings from our A/B testing with students.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kenechukwu Nwosu\n**Job title:** Curriculum Director\n**Company:** TheGraphCourses.org\n**Bio:**\n[Kene David Nwosu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kene-david-nwosu/) is an epidemiologist (PhDc) at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, and curriculum director of [The GRAPH Courses](https://thegraphcourses.org), a WHO-supported non-profit providing open-source R and Python training to health and life-science professionals across 50+ countries. Originally from Nigeria, Kene is passionate about expanding global access to data and AI literacy. With GRAPH , he is developing [ChalkTalk](https://github.com/the-graph-courses/chalktalk), an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert textbooks, papers, and plain-text lessons into adaptive, multilingual teaching videos for personalized learning at scale.\n\n## Title: Empowering Learners with WebR, Pyodide, and Quarto\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWebR, Pyodide, and Quarto are powerful technologies that let you run code exercises in the Web browser. Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p><a href=\"http://mine-cr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<\/strong><\/a> (she/her) is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit.

Many developers struggle to implement proper testing due to time constraints and technical barriers. To address this challenge, we're introducing an innovative solution that automatically generates regression tests for existing Shiny apps. By leveraging AI models trained on testing best practices, the Shiny package will streamline the testing process, making it more accessible and efficient for developers of all skill levels.\n\n**Speaker name:** Karan Gathani\n**Job title:** Software QA Engineer\n**Company:** Posit PBC\n**Bio:**\nKaran is currently a Shiny Software QA Engineer at Posit. Karan has a history of working with tech startups in the San Francisco Bay Area helping them ship products efficiently without compromising on quality. In his spare time, he likes to participate in BioBlitzes organized around the Bay Area and contributing to this natural history blog.\n\n## Title: Playing nice with ecosystems: cross-platform anywidgets for interactive computing\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nanywidget is a specification and toolkit for authoring reusable interactive widgets, bridging modern web technologies with Python. It defines a standard for interactive elements that work across Jupyter, VS Code, Positron IDE, and web frameworks like Shiny for Python and Solara. While many platforms integrate anywidget through a Jupyter-compatibility layer, others have adopted it natively, extending its reach beyond Jupyter. This decoupling has also enabled early experiments with non-Python runtimes like R and Deno. By prioritizing flexibility and interoperability, anywidget helps library developers make their tools more widely usable and enables framework authors to bootstrap rich interactive ecosystems without platform lock-in.\n\n**Speaker name:** Trevor Manz\n**Job title:** Engineer\n**Company:** marimo\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Teaching Shiny Assistant Kung-Fu\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nTeaching an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to utilize a newly developed Python package is nearly impossible without access to the system prompt. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but they lack the knowledge to interact seamlessly with new, untrained packages. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how Shiny Assistant automatically enhances its system prompt based on the required Python packages for the user’s Shiny Application. This generated prompt leverages the packages’ existing documentation and computed strong types. Providing this additional dynamic context delivers a custom Shiny Assistant experience, tailored to the user's needs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Barret Schloerke\n**Job title:** Shiny Team Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n`hello()`! Dr. Barret Schloerke is a Shiny Software Engineer at Posit. He created and maintains many R packages surrounding the Shiny ecosystem, including {shinylive}, {shinytest2}, and {reactlog}. In addition to his work in R, Barret also works on Shiny for Python, implementing its testing tools, bookmarking, and interactive data frame experience.\n\n## Title: shinystate: Launching collaboration and session management to new heights in Shiny applications\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nShiny is being used more regularly as a front end to sophisticated workflows in data science, often with a large number of inputs and intricate reactivity. End users desire a way to save their progress through the application workflow and share their state of the application with others for review. For small applications, the existing Shiny bookmarkable state feature is a valid approach. However, many of the production Shiny applications I've created require more granular control. Enter {shinystate}, my new R package that offers an intuitive class system and integration with {pins} to let developers choose where to save application state, ability to save multiple sessions at once, and bring collaboration to new heights for end users.\n\n**Speaker name:** Eric Nantz\n**Job title:** Statistician\n**Company:** Eli Lilly\n**Bio:**\nEric Nantz is a director within the statistical innovation center at Eli Lilly and Company, creating analytical pipelines and capabilities of advanced statistical methodologies for clinical design used in multiple phases of development. Outside of his day job, Eric is passionate about connecting with and showcasing the brilliant R community in multiple ways. You may recognize his voice from the [R-Podcast](https://r-podcast.org) that he launched in 2012.

It defines a standard for interactive elements that work across Jupyter, VS Code, Positron IDE, and web frameworks like Shiny for Python and Solara. While many platforms integrate anywidget through a Jupyter-compatibility layer, others have adopted it natively, extending its reach beyond Jupyter. This decoupling has also enabled early experiments with non-Python runtimes like R and Deno. By prioritizing flexibility and interoperability, anywidget helps library developers make their tools more widely usable and enables framework authors to bootstrap rich interactive ecosystems without platform lock-in.\n\n**Speaker name:** Trevor Manz\n**Job title:** Engineer\n**Company:** marimo\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Teaching Shiny Assistant Kung-Fu\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nTeaching an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to utilize a newly developed Python package is nearly impossible without access to the system prompt. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but they lack the knowledge to interact seamlessly with new, untrained packages. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how Shiny Assistant automatically enhances its system prompt based on the required Python packages for the user’s Shiny Application. This generated prompt leverages the packages’ existing documentation and computed strong types. Providing this additional dynamic context delivers a custom Shiny Assistant experience, tailored to the user's needs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Barret Schloerke\n**Job title:** Shiny Team Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n`hello()`! Dr. Barret Schloerke is a Shiny Software Engineer at Posit. He created and maintains many R packages surrounding the Shiny ecosystem, including {shinylive}, {shinytest2}, and {reactlog}. In addition to his work in R, Barret also works on Shiny for Python, implementing its testing tools, bookmarking, and interactive data frame experience.\n\n## Title: shinystate: Launching collaboration and session management to new heights in Shiny applications\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nShiny is being used more regularly as a front end to sophisticated workflows in data science, often with a large number of inputs and intricate reactivity. End users desire a way to save their progress through the application workflow and share their state of the application with others for review. For small applications, the existing Shiny bookmarkable state feature is a valid approach. However, many of the production Shiny applications I've created require more granular control. Enter {shinystate}, my new R package that offers an intuitive class system and integration with {pins} to let developers choose where to save application state, ability to save multiple sessions at once, and bring collaboration to new heights for end users.\n\n**Speaker name:** Eric Nantz\n**Job title:** Statistician\n**Company:** Eli Lilly\n**Bio:**\nEric Nantz is a director within the statistical innovation center at Eli Lilly and Company, creating analytical pipelines and capabilities of advanced statistical methodologies for clinical design used in multiple phases of development.

It defines a standard for interactive elements that work across Jupyter, VS Code, Positron IDE, and web frameworks like Shiny for Python and Solara. While many platforms integrate anywidget through a Jupyter-compatibility layer, others have adopted it natively, extending its reach beyond Jupyter. This decoupling has also enabled early experiments with non-Python runtimes like R and Deno. By prioritizing flexibility and interoperability, anywidget helps library developers make their tools more widely usable and enables framework authors to bootstrap rich interactive ecosystems without platform lock-in.\n\n**Speaker name:** Trevor Manz\n**Job title:** Engineer\n**Company:** marimo\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Teaching Shiny Assistant Kung-Fu\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nTeaching an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to utilize a newly developed Python package is nearly impossible without access to the system prompt. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but they lack the knowledge to interact seamlessly with new, untrained packages. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how Shiny Assistant automatically enhances its system prompt based on the required Python packages for the user’s Shiny Application. This generated prompt leverages the packages’ existing documentation and computed strong types. Providing this additional dynamic context delivers a custom Shiny Assistant experience, tailored to the user's needs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Barret Schloerke\n**Job title:** Shiny Team Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n`hello()`!

First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claus Wilke\n**Job title:** Professor\n**Company:** The University of Texas at Austin\n**Bio:**\nClaus Wilke is a computational biologist and data scientist at The University of Texas at Austin, running a research lab that studies protein and peptide biochemistry. Claus is also the author of the book \"Fundamentals of Data Visualization,\" and he teaches data visualization at The University of Texas, both at the undergraduate and at the graduate level. He is an avid user of and regular contributor to the R ecosystem. He has authored several popular R packages used for data visualization, such as cowplot, ggridges, and ggtext.\n\n## Title: ChalkTalk: Globalizing Data Science Education with AI-generated Videos\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWe present ChalkTalk, an open-source tool that converts Quarto documents into engaging educational videos with AI-powered voices and avatars. By adding simple text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-video (TTV) attributes to markdown files, educators can automatically generate multilingual video content while maintaining the reproducibility benefits of Quarto. At The GRAPH Courses, where we've trained over 3,000 learners globally, we are testing out this tool to scale our video content creation. We'll demonstrate its integration with Quarto and present preliminary findings from our A/B testing with students.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kenechukwu Nwosu\n**Job title:** Curriculum Director\n**Company:** TheGraphCourses.org\n**Bio:**\n[Kene David Nwosu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kene-david-nwosu/) is an epidemiologist (PhDc) at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, and curriculum director of [The GRAPH Courses](https://thegraphcourses.org), a WHO-supported non-profit providing open-source R and Python training to health and life-science professionals across 50+ countries. Originally from Nigeria, Kene is passionate about expanding global access to data and AI literacy. With GRAPH , he is developing [ChalkTalk](https://github.com/the-graph-courses/chalktalk), an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert textbooks, papers, and plain-text lessons into adaptive, multilingual teaching videos for personalized learning at scale.\n\n## Title: Empowering Learners with WebR, Pyodide, and Quarto\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWebR, Pyodide, and Quarto are powerful technologies that let you run code exercises in the Web browser. Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p><a href=\"http://mine-cr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<\/strong><\/a> (she/her) is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit.

Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street!

He received a PhD in Astrophysics from Rice University and his undergraduate degree in astronomy from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n## Title: Keeping Data Alive: Persistent Storage Options for Dynamic Cloud Applications\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBuilding cloud-based data applications that evolve over time requires persistent storage solutions. Without a way to record new information or modify datasets, applications like Shiny or Streamlit would reset after each session, losing potentially valuable information. This talk explores persistent storage options ranging from lightweight solutions like Google Sheets to scalable services like Amazon S3 and MotherDuck. We’ll also cover securing connections to these services using Posit Connect Cloud’s secret variable management. By the end, you’ll understand common persistent storage solutions, their trade-offs, and how to choose the best approach for your specific project.\n\n**Speaker name:** Alex Chisholm\n**Job title:** Product Manager, Cloud Platforms\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nAlex Chisholm is a data professional turned product manager.

He now lives in Pittsburgh, PA with his wife and two daughters.\n\n## Title: Get your ducks in a row... faster Shiny apps with DuckDB\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nOur small team tackled sluggish Shiny applications by implementing DuckDB as a cache layer, transforming slow, resource-intensive operations into responsive user experiences. Initially, our application pulled data directly from SQL Server, performing real-time aggregations that resulted in poor response times. By restructuring our pipeline to pre-compute results in DuckDB, we significantly improved performance. This presentation demonstrates how we identified bottlenecks, implemented DuckDB integration, and measured improvements. We'll share practical examples of DuckDB integration with R, discuss trade-offs, and show how this accessible solution can benefit other small teams with limited resources.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Albino Hegeman\n**Job title:** Data Analyst\n**Company:** NYS OGS\n**Bio:**\nI am a data manager and geospatial analyst with 20+ years of experience.

But for many, the idea of integrating LLM APIs into their workflows feels daunting. This workshop is here to show you otherwise.\n<br><br>\nWe’ll introduce you to elmer (R) and chatlas (Python), two user-friendly packages developed by Posit that make calling LLMs from code surprisingly straightforward. These tools handle the complexities of conversation history, tool calling, vision support, and more, so you can focus on experimentation and creativity. They also integrate nicely with Shiny for R and Python, where you can easily create chat interfaces or build custom web apps around LLM workflows.\n<br><br>\nAlong the way, we’ll explore system prompt design, token management, tool calling, and structured output, all while building familiarity with the various models and vendors that are shaping the AI landscape today.\n<br><br>\nYou’ll discover that:\n<ul>\n<li> Calling LLMs from code unlocks new possibilities that go far beyond what’s achievable with off-the-shelf tools like ChatGPT.<\/li>\n<li> It’s easier than you think—no advanced AI background required.<\/li>\n<li> It’s incredibly fun and rewarding to bring your own ideas to life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThis workshop is perfect for those curious about AI but unsure where to start, as well as for seasoned developers looking to learn about Posit’s new tools. We’ll also touch on more advanced topics like fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You’ll get hands-on experience with guided projects or with the flexibility to explore using your own projects.\n<br><br>\nIf you’ve been sitting on the fence, wondering whether LLMs are worth diving into, this workshop will give you the hands-on experience and confidence you need to get started.\n<br><br>\n\n**Speaker name:** Garrick Aden-Buie\n**Job title:** Software Engineer, Shiny\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p>Garrick Aden-Buie is a software engineer for Shiny at Posit.

Doing both seemed impossible. I argue that this has changed drastically, as we have built out an effective multilingual data science team at Ketchbrook, thanks to polars/dplyr, gt/great-tables, ggplot2/plotnine, arrow, duckdb, Quarto, etc. I would like to provide a walk through of our journey to developing a multilingual data science team, lessons learned, and best practices.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Thomas\n**Job title:** Chief Data Scientist\n**Company:** Ketchbrook Analytics\n**Bio:**\nMichael Thomas is the Chief Data Scientist at Ketchbrook Analytics, a data science consulting firm based out of Hartford, CT.  He holds a B.S. in Accounting and Mathematics from Stonehill College, and an M.S. in Business Intelligence & Analytics from Saint Joseph’s University.

He is also the co-host of the RWeekly Highlights Podcast with Eric Nantz.\n\n## Title: Polyglot Data Science: Why and How to Combine R and Python\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nDoing everything in one language is convenient but not always possible. For example, your Python app might need an algorithm only available as an R package. Or your R analysis might need to fit into a Python pipeline. What do you do? You take a polyglot approach! Many data scientists hesitate to explore beyond their main language, but combining R and Python can be powerful. In my talk, I’ll explain why polyglot data science is beneficial and address common concerns. Then, I’ll show you how to make it happen using tools like Quarto, Positron, Reticulate, and the Unix command line. By the end, you’ll gain a fresh perspective and practical ideas to start.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jeroen Janssens\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: When R Met Python: A Meet Cute on Posit Connect\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nData teams often leverage multiple programming languages—driven by a multitude of reasons, be it task-specific requirements or personal preference. In this talk, I'll share how we enabled our developer base to build in the language of their choice, and how we leverage Posit Connect to unify them. By exposing core functionality as APIs using R’s plumber and Python’s FastAPI packages, and building parity in internal packages for both languages, we created a shared toolkit that streamlines workflows and fosters collaboration. Join me to explore our journey in breaking down language barriers and empowering data innovation.\n\n**Speaker name:** Blake Abbenante\n**Job title:** Director, Analytics & Data Science\n**Company:** Suffolk Construction\n**Bio:**\nBlake is a seasoned leader in data analytics and business intelligence, currently serving as the Director of Analytics & Data Science at Suffolk Construction.

No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms.\n<br>The takeaway? With the right tools, teams can mix and match languages, leveraging the best in each, and still build solid, scalable solutions.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claudia Penaloza\n**Job title:** Data Scientist\n**Company:** Continental Tires\n**Bio:**\nClaudia Penaloza is a Data Scientist at Continental Tires, where she has spent seven years developing and industrializing data-driven, statistical, and machine learning solutions across the company (R&D, Manufacturing, Market Intelligence, Controlling, etc.).

A decades-long competitive cyclist, she’s proud to bring her analytical skills to her favorite tire company.\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n\n**Speakers:** \nJames Black , Executive Director, Technology and Scientific Computing, Novartis  \n  \nOrla Doyle , Data Scientist, Novartis  \n  \nDoug Kelkhoff , Roche  \n  \nMichael Mayer , Posit\n\n**Time:** Tuesday, Sep 169:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  \n**Location:** International South\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research. This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.

Learn how to use this package to speed up your existing dplyr codes with little to no changes, and how to work with larger-than-memory data using a syntax that not only feels like dplyr for data frames, but behaves exactly like that.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kirill Müller\n**Job title:** Partner\n**Company:** cynkra GmbH\n**Bio:**\nKirill has been working on the boundary between data and computer science for more than 25 years and is co-founder and partner at cynkra, a Zurich-based data science consultancy.\n\n## Title: Semantic Search for the Rest of Us with DuckDB\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSemantic search matches a search query against documents not just by directly matching words, but by ranking results using semantic meaning  - for example searching for “cat” could also turn up documents that have “tiger.” \n<br><br>\nWhile many enterprise level solutions exist for semantic search, I will show a low memory  technique in Python that enables live semantic search for small to medium document collections that need to be deployed in constrained memory/ CPU environments - such as Posit Connect Cloud or a small cloud server.\n<br><br>\nI will show how a web app (such as Shiny for Python) using just a few hundred megabytes of memory can enable live search using the fixed array support in DuckDB, and the open source library LlamaCPP.\n\n**Speaker name:** Marcos Huerta\n**Job title:** Manager, Data Science\n**Company:** Carmax\n**Bio:**\nMarcos Huerta is a Data Science Manager at Carmax in Richmond, Virginia since 2019 where he works on pricing algorithms for the Core Pricing Systems team.

Prior to his career in the private sector data, Marcos worked in science policy in Washington DC area, most recently for the U.S. Department of Energy.  He received a PhD in Astrophysics from Rice University and his undergraduate degree in astronomy from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n## Title: Keeping Data Alive: Persistent Storage Options for Dynamic Cloud Applications\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBuilding cloud-based data applications that evolve over time requires persistent storage solutions. Without a way to record new information or modify datasets, applications like Shiny or Streamlit would reset after each session, losing potentially valuable information. This talk explores persistent storage options ranging from lightweight solutions like Google Sheets to scalable services like Amazon S3 and MotherDuck. We’ll also cover securing connections to these services using Posit Connect Cloud’s secret variable management. By the end, you’ll understand common persistent storage solutions, their trade-offs, and how to choose the best approach for your specific project.\n\n**Speaker name:** Alex Chisholm\n**Job title:** Product Manager, Cloud Platforms\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nAlex Chisholm is a data professional turned product manager. He works at Posit on Posit Cloud, shinyapps.io, and Connect Cloud, a new online publishing platform for data applications and documents.

He now lives in Pittsburgh, PA with his wife and two daughters.\n\n## Title: Get your ducks in a row... faster Shiny apps with DuckDB\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nOur small team tackled sluggish Shiny applications by implementing DuckDB as a cache layer, transforming slow, resource-intensive operations into responsive user experiences. Initially, our application pulled data directly from SQL Server, performing real-time aggregations that resulted in poor response times. By restructuring our pipeline to pre-compute results in DuckDB, we significantly improved performance. This presentation demonstrates how we identified bottlenecks, implemented DuckDB integration, and measured improvements. We'll share practical examples of DuckDB integration with R, discuss trade-offs, and show how this accessible solution can benefit other small teams with limited resources.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Albino Hegeman\n**Job title:** Data Analyst\n**Company:** NYS OGS\n**Bio:**\nI am a data manager and geospatial analyst with 20+ years of experience.

Doing both seemed impossible. I argue that this has changed drastically, as we have built out an effective multilingual data science team at Ketchbrook, thanks to polars/dplyr, gt/great-tables, ggplot2/plotnine, arrow, duckdb, Quarto, etc. I would like to provide a walk through of our journey to developing a multilingual data science team, lessons learned, and best practices.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Thomas\n**Job title:** Chief Data Scientist\n**Company:** Ketchbrook Analytics\n**Bio:**\nMichael Thomas is the Chief Data Scientist at Ketchbrook Analytics, a data science consulting firm based out of Hartford, CT.  He holds a B.S. in Accounting and Mathematics from Stonehill College, and an M.S. in Business Intelligence & Analytics from Saint Joseph’s University.  He leads Ketchbrook's data science consulting and software-as-a-service practices.  He is also the co-host of the RWeekly Highlights Podcast with Eric Nantz.\n\n## Title: Polyglot Data Science: Why and How to Combine R and Python\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nDoing everything in one language is convenient but not always possible. For example, your Python app might need an algorithm only available as an R package. Or your R analysis might need to fit into a Python pipeline. What do you do? You take a polyglot approach! Many data scientists hesitate to explore beyond their main language, but combining R and Python can be powerful. In my talk, I’ll explain why polyglot data science is beneficial and address common concerns. Then, I’ll show you how to make it happen using tools like Quarto, Positron, Reticulate, and the Unix command line. By the end, you’ll gain a fresh perspective and practical ideas to start.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jeroen Janssens\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: When R Met Python: A Meet Cute on Posit Connect\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nData teams often leverage multiple programming languages—driven by a multitude of reasons, be it task-specific requirements or personal preference. In this talk, I'll share how we enabled our developer base to build in the language of their choice, and how we leverage Posit Connect to unify them. By exposing core functionality as APIs using R’s plumber and Python’s FastAPI packages, and building parity in internal packages for both languages, we created a shared toolkit that streamlines workflows and fosters collaboration. Join me to explore our journey in breaking down language barriers and empowering data innovation.\n\n**Speaker name:** Blake Abbenante\n**Job title:** Director, Analytics & Data Science\n**Company:** Suffolk Construction\n**Bio:**\nBlake is a seasoned leader in data analytics and business intelligence, currently serving as the Director of Analytics & Data Science at Suffolk Construction.

His expertise spans data-driven decision-making, predictive modeling, machine learning applications, and business intelligence solutions that enhance operational efficiency and profitability.\n\n## Title: R & Python playing nice, in production\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nHi, I’m Claudia Peñaloza, a Data Scientist at Continental Tires, where going data-driven can be an adventure.\n<br>What started as a proof of concept a few years ago, evolved into Conti’s first-ever Predictive Machine Learning Model for R&D! \n<br>A baby, a wedding, two lateral moves, and three hires later, our team had also evolved… from mostly R to mostly Python developers. \n<br>Rewriting 1000+ commits? No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms.\n<br>The takeaway? With the right tools, teams can mix and match languages, leveraging the best in each, and still build solid, scalable solutions.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claudia Penaloza\n**Job title:** Data Scientist\n**Company:** Continental Tires\n**Bio:**\nClaudia Penaloza is a Data Scientist at Continental Tires, where she has spent seven years developing and industrializing data-driven, statistical, and machine learning solutions across the company (R&D, Manufacturing, Market Intelligence, Controlling, etc.). She holds a Ph.D. in Quantitative Ecology, with a background in endangered species population modeling and simulation research. A self-taught R user, Claudia turned to R out of desperation to escape regenerating plots through hundreds of manual clicks in Excel after every simulation update. Her passion for efficient, reproducible analysis has only grown since. A decades-long competitive cyclist, she’s proud to bring her analytical skills to her favorite tire company.\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n\n**Speakers:** \nJames Black , Executive Director, Technology and Scientific Computing, Novartis  \n  \nOrla Doyle , Data Scientist, Novartis  \n  \nDoug Kelkhoff , Roche  \n  \nMichael Mayer , Posit\n\n**Time:** Tuesday, Sep 169:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  \n**Location:** International South\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research. This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.

He received a PhD in Astrophysics from Rice University and his undergraduate degree in astronomy from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n## Title: Keeping Data Alive: Persistent Storage Options for Dynamic Cloud Applications\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBuilding cloud-based data applications that evolve over time requires persistent storage solutions. Without a way to record new information or modify datasets, applications like Shiny or Streamlit would reset after each session, losing potentially valuable information. This talk explores persistent storage options ranging from lightweight solutions like Google Sheets to scalable services like Amazon S3 and MotherDuck. We’ll also cover securing connections to these services using Posit Connect Cloud’s secret variable management. By the end, you’ll understand common persistent storage solutions, their trade-offs, and how to choose the best approach for your specific project.\n\n**Speaker name:** Alex Chisholm\n**Job title:** Product Manager, Cloud Platforms\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nAlex Chisholm is a data professional turned product manager. He works at Posit on Posit Cloud, shinyapps.io, and Connect Cloud, a new online publishing platform for data applications and documents.

He now lives in Pittsburgh, PA with his wife and two daughters.\n\n## Title: Get your ducks in a row... faster Shiny apps with DuckDB\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nOur small team tackled sluggish Shiny applications by implementing DuckDB as a cache layer, transforming slow, resource-intensive operations into responsive user experiences. Initially, our application pulled data directly from SQL Server, performing real-time aggregations that resulted in poor response times. By restructuring our pipeline to pre-compute results in DuckDB, we significantly improved performance. This presentation demonstrates how we identified bottlenecks, implemented DuckDB integration, and measured improvements. We'll share practical examples of DuckDB integration with R, discuss trade-offs, and show how this accessible solution can benefit other small teams with limited resources.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Albino Hegeman\n**Job title:** Data Analyst\n**Company:** NYS OGS\n**Bio:**\nI am a data manager and geospatial analyst with 20+ years of experience.

For example, your Python app might need an algorithm only available as an R package. Or your R analysis might need to fit into a Python pipeline. What do you do? You take a polyglot approach! Many data scientists hesitate to explore beyond their main language, but combining R and Python can be powerful. In my talk, I’ll explain why polyglot data science is beneficial and address common concerns. Then, I’ll show you how to make it happen using tools like Quarto, Positron, Reticulate, and the Unix command line. By the end, you’ll gain a fresh perspective and practical ideas to start.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jeroen Janssens\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: When R Met Python: A Meet Cute on Posit Connect\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nData teams often leverage multiple programming languages—driven by a multitude of reasons, be it task-specific requirements or personal preference. In this talk, I'll share how we enabled our developer base to build in the language of their choice, and how we leverage Posit Connect to unify them. By exposing core functionality as APIs using R’s plumber and Python’s FastAPI packages, and building parity in internal packages for both languages, we created a shared toolkit that streamlines workflows and fosters collaboration. Join me to explore our journey in breaking down language barriers and empowering data innovation.\n\n**Speaker name:** Blake Abbenante\n**Job title:** Director, Analytics & Data Science\n**Company:** Suffolk Construction\n**Bio:**\nBlake is a seasoned leader in data analytics and business intelligence, currently serving as the Director of Analytics & Data Science at Suffolk Construction.

No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms.\n<br>The takeaway? With the right tools, teams can mix and match languages, leveraging the best in each, and still build solid, scalable solutions.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claudia Penaloza\n**Job title:** Data Scientist\n**Company:** Continental Tires\n**Bio:**\nClaudia Penaloza is a Data Scientist at Continental Tires, where she has spent seven years developing and industrializing data-driven, statistical, and machine learning solutions across the company (R&D, Manufacturing, Market Intelligence, Controlling, etc.).

A decades-long competitive cyclist, she’s proud to bring her analytical skills to her favorite tire company.\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n\n**Speakers:** \nJames Black , Executive Director, Technology and Scientific Computing, Novartis  \n  \nOrla Doyle , Data Scientist, Novartis  \n  \nDoug Kelkhoff , Roche  \n  \nMichael Mayer , Posit\n\n**Time:** Tuesday, Sep 169:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  \n**Location:** International South\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research. This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process.

Prior to his career in the private sector data, Marcos worked in science policy in Washington DC area, most recently for the U.S. Department of Energy.  He received a PhD in Astrophysics from Rice University and his undergraduate degree in astronomy from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n## Title: Keeping Data Alive: Persistent Storage Options for Dynamic Cloud Applications\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBuilding cloud-based data applications that evolve over time requires persistent storage solutions. Without a way to record new information or modify datasets, applications like Shiny or Streamlit would reset after each session, losing potentially valuable information. This talk explores persistent storage options ranging from lightweight solutions like Google Sheets to scalable services like Amazon S3 and MotherDuck. We’ll also cover securing connections to these services using Posit Connect Cloud’s secret variable management. By the end, you’ll understand common persistent storage solutions, their trade-offs, and how to choose the best approach for your specific project.\n\n**Speaker name:** Alex Chisholm\n**Job title:** Product Manager, Cloud Platforms\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nAlex Chisholm is a data professional turned product manager.

Initially, our application pulled data directly from SQL Server, performing real-time aggregations that resulted in poor response times. By restructuring our pipeline to pre-compute results in DuckDB, we significantly improved performance. This presentation demonstrates how we identified bottlenecks, implemented DuckDB integration, and measured improvements. We'll share practical examples of DuckDB integration with R, discuss trade-offs, and show how this accessible solution can benefit other small teams with limited resources.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Albino Hegeman\n**Job title:** Data Analyst\n**Company:** NYS OGS\n**Bio:**\nI am a data manager and geospatial analyst with 20+ years of experience.

Enter EcoCommons, a cutting-edge platform built on an R package that’s scientifically rigorous and designed for scale. EcoCommons efficiently runs millions of models to help researchers, governments, and NGOs make data-driven decisions. Whether it's predicting habitat loss, optimising conservation strategies, or advising policy, this platform turns R into a powerhouse for real-world impact—all while building a thriving community of practice. In this talk, we’ll explore the challenges of running R at scale, lessons learned, and how our community is shaping the future of modelling.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jenna Wraith\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Precision Medicine for All: Using Tidymodels to Validate PRS in Brazil\n**Code:** PAR-013\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPolygenic risk scores (PRS) are a powerful way to measure someone’s risk for common diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, most PRS are developed using data from European populations, making it challenging to generalize results to other ancestries. In this talk, I’ll show how I used tidymodels tools—like yardstick, recipes, and workflows—to calculate metrics and validate a breast cancer PRS in the highly admixed Brazilian population. You will learn how to leverage tidymodels to make precision medicine more inclusive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Flávia E. Rius\n**Job title:** Data Scientist / Researcher\n**Company:** Mendelics / University of São Paulo\n**Bio:**\nFlávia E. Rius is a data scientist and bioinformatician interested in evaluating Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) in the highly admixed Brazilian population. She works at Mendelics, the largest company specialized in genetic diagnostic tests in Brazil, and conducts postdoctoral research at the University of São Paulo. She is also passionate about solving problems on diverse topics within the realm of R and bioinformatics, which she accomplishes through mentoring sessions and occasional freelance jobs.\n\n## Title: Demystifying MLOps with Vetiver\n**Code:** PAR-013\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nMLOps is the process of setting up a Machine Learning lifecycle, including model training, deployment and monitoring. It is a complex topic which brings together an understanding of data processing, modelling and cloud architecture. It is therefore not surprising that many newcomers (myself included) can feel intimidated by the subject. In this talk I will draw on my experience as an organiser of local data science meetups. I will go into how MLOps is often presented within the data science community, how it could be made more accessible to students and beginners, and my current process for teaching MLOps in R and Python using my favourite package, vetiver.

For example, your Python app might need an algorithm only available as an R package. Or your R analysis might need to fit into a Python pipeline. What do you do? You take a polyglot approach! Many data scientists hesitate to explore beyond their main language, but combining R and Python can be powerful. In my talk, I’ll explain why polyglot data science is beneficial and address common concerns. Then, I’ll show you how to make it happen using tools like Quarto, Positron, Reticulate, and the Unix command line. By the end, you’ll gain a fresh perspective and practical ideas to start.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jeroen Janssens\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: When R Met Python: A Meet Cute on Posit Connect\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nData teams often leverage multiple programming languages—driven by a multitude of reasons, be it task-specific requirements or personal preference. In this talk, I'll share how we enabled our developer base to build in the language of their choice, and how we leverage Posit Connect to unify them. By exposing core functionality as APIs using R’s plumber and Python’s FastAPI packages, and building parity in internal packages for both languages, we created a shared toolkit that streamlines workflows and fosters collaboration. Join me to explore our journey in breaking down language barriers and empowering data innovation.\n\n**Speaker name:** Blake Abbenante\n**Job title:** Director, Analytics & Data Science\n**Company:** Suffolk Construction\n**Bio:**\nBlake is a seasoned leader in data analytics and business intelligence, currently serving as the Director of Analytics & Data Science at Suffolk Construction.

No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms.\n<br>The takeaway? With the right tools, teams can mix and match languages, leveraging the best in each, and still build solid, scalable solutions.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claudia Penaloza\n**Job title:** Data Scientist\n**Company:** Continental Tires\n**Bio:**\nClaudia Penaloza is a Data Scientist at Continental Tires, where she has spent seven years developing and industrializing data-driven, statistical, and machine learning solutions across the company (R&D, Manufacturing, Market Intelligence, Controlling, etc.).

A decades-long competitive cyclist, she’s proud to bring her analytical skills to her favorite tire company.\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n\n**Speakers:** \nJames Black , Executive Director, Technology and Scientific Computing, Novartis  \n  \nOrla Doyle , Data Scientist, Novartis  \n  \nDoug Kelkhoff , Roche  \n  \nMichael Mayer , Posit\n\n**Time:** Tuesday, Sep 169:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  \n**Location:** International South\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research. This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.
