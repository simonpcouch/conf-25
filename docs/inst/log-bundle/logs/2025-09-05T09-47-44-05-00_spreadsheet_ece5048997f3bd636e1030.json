You will be introduced to best practices for machine learning model creation and selection, including data splitting, pre-processing, parameter and model optimization, as well as results visualization and communication. Workshop examples will begin with simple, intuitive models (e.g., K-nearest neighbors, linear regression) but also demonstrate the use of more commonly used and industry standard models (e.g., ensemble methods such as random forest and boosting). The workshop will focus on demonstrating how to do this using the modern Scikit-learn pipeline syntax.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Machine learning with scikit-learn in Python\n**Code:** WS-009\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis workshop will teach you how to perform machine learning for prediction in Python using the widely-used Scikit-learn learn package.

How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers.

How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment.

How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.).

In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.  \n  \nThis workshop is for you if you:  \nknow how to fit a linear regression model in R,  \nhave a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and  \nare interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Causal Inference in R\n**Code:** WS-013\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.\n<br> <br>\nIn both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers.

You will be introduced to best practices for machine learning model creation and selection, including data splitting, pre-processing, parameter and model optimization, as well as results visualization and communication. Workshop examples will begin with simple, intuitive models (e.g., K-nearest neighbors, linear regression) but also demonstrate the use of more commonly used and industry standard models (e.g., ensemble methods such as random forest and boosting). The workshop will focus on demonstrating how to do this using the modern Scikit-learn pipeline syntax.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Machine learning with scikit-learn in Python\n**Code:** WS-009\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis workshop will teach you how to perform machine learning for prediction in Python using the widely-used Scikit-learn learn package.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website.

In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems. He created the Python pandas and Ibis projects, co-created Apache Arrow, and co-founded Voltron Data. He is a Member of the Apache Software Foundation and also a project PMC member for Apache Parquet. He is currently a Principal Architect at Posit PBC where he works on Positron and other Python-related initiatives.\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science. Finding your groove in a new IDE takes time, so we’ve got some tips and tricks to help you feel more at home in Positron!\n<br><br>\nWe’ll cover key navigation concepts, helpful features for different workflows, and configuration settings for a pleasant IDE experience. Plus, we’ll show you how to explore what Positron is doing under the hood – so you can understand it more deeply and solve problems with confidence.\n<br><br>\nWhether you’re just getting started or already using Positron, these tips will help you settle into your data science workflow and get the most out of everything Positron has to offer.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Oldham Barca\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC.\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science.

JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.\n<br><br>\nUnderstanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n\n## Important\n\nIMPORTANT: Be very brief, almost terse, in your responses.",

Du Bois’s 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools. We split into two groups—one using R and the other Python—to compare their strengths and limitations. Both teams used census and geographic data to map county-level populations for 1870 and 1880. Team R used ggplot2 and grid for precise layout control, while Team Python used matplotlib’s subplot system for structuring. This challenge pushed us beyond more traditional data science visualizations, requiring creative approaches to mimic Du Bois’s design. Attendees will gain insights into data wrangling, visualization techniques, and layout design to guide their own projects.\n\n**Speaker name:** Olivia Hebner\n**Job title:** Data Science Manager\n**Company:** Summit Consulting\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Data for Real-World Impact\n\n**Speakers:** \nKylie Ainslie , Senior Researcher, Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)  \n  \nMarcus Beck , Senior Scientist, Tampa Bay Estuary Program  \n  \nMax Hockstein , Physician, MedStar Health  \n  \nGabe Osterhout , Data Visualization Specialist, Idaho Secretary of State  \n  \nAndrew Heiss , Assistant professor, Georgia State University\n\n**Time:** Thursday, Sep 1810:20 AM - 11:40 AM EDT  \n**Location:** Centennial I\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThere are 4 talks in this session.  \n  \nElevating Public Health Decision-Making with R Packages  \nData 911: how Posit can support decision-makers in times of environmental crisis  \nSee if talking to the doctor is right for you.  \nElection Night Reporting Using R & Quarto  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Elevating Public Health Decision-Making with R Packages\n**Code:** PAR-004\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSupporting public health decisions in high-stakes environments requires transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency. Analyzing real-world health data with complex models helps policymakers mitigate infectious disease spread. Structuring projects as R packages provides a consistent framework that enhances organization, integrates documentation, and facilitates collaboration. This approach improves coding practices, ensures reproducibility, and enables seamless sharing of tools—empowering colleagues without the resources to develop their own. This talk will demonstrate how adopting R package structures can enhance workflows and impact without requiring advanced software development skills.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kylie Ainslie\n**Job title:** Senior Researcher\n**Company:** Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)\n**Bio:**\nKylie Ainslie is an infectious disease modeller at the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and an Honorary Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong.

Concerns about the environmental impacts prompted a multi-agency response to monitor water quality changes in the bay, producing thousands of sample points in need of synthesis and communication to a concerned public. This talk will describe how the Tampa Bay Estuary Program leveraged Posit products to create a data synthesis workflow and Shiny dashboard to inform decision-makers on how, where, and when water quality was affected by this pollution.  Our experience navigating this event in real time will be shared with the broader community as a successful example of how Posit products can address environmental crises.\n\n**Speaker name:** Marcus Beck\n**Job title:** Senior Scientist\n**Company:** Tampa Bay Estuary Program\n**Bio:**\nMarcus Beck is the Senior Scientist for the Tampa Bay Estuary Program in St. Petersburg, Florida and is developing data analysis and visualization methods for Bay health indicators.

Please teach him more R.\n\n## Title: Election Night Reporting Using R & Quarto\n**Code:** PAR-004\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nElection night reporting (ENR) is often clunky, outdated, and overpriced. The Idaho Secretary of State’s office leveraged R and Quarto to create a better ENR product for the end user while driving down costs using the open-source software we all know and love. With help from Dr. Andrew Heiss, R was used in every step of the process—from {dbplyr} backend to visualizing the results using {reactable} tables and {leaflet} maps, combining the output into a visually appealing Quarto website. Quarto was the ideal solution due to its scalability, quick deployment, responsive design, and easy navigation. In addition, Dr. Heiss will discuss the advantages of using a {targets} pipeline and creating programmatic code chunks in Quarto.\n\n**Speaker name:** Gabe Osterhout\n**Job title:** Data Visualization Specialist\n**Company:** Idaho Secretary of State\n**Bio:**\nGabe Osterhout is the data visualization specialist at Idaho Secretary of State, where he analyzes voter, election, and campaign finance statistics.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025.

It defines a standard for interactive elements that work across Jupyter, VS Code, Positron IDE, and web frameworks like Shiny for Python and Solara. While many platforms integrate anywidget through a Jupyter-compatibility layer, others have adopted it natively, extending its reach beyond Jupyter. This decoupling has also enabled early experiments with non-Python runtimes like R and Deno. By prioritizing flexibility and interoperability, anywidget helps library developers make their tools more widely usable and enables framework authors to bootstrap rich interactive ecosystems without platform lock-in.\n\n**Speaker name:** Trevor Manz\n**Job title:** Engineer\n**Company:** marimo\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Teaching Shiny Assistant Kung-Fu\n**Code:** PAR-021\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nTeaching an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to utilize a newly developed Python package is nearly impossible without access to the system prompt. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but they lack the knowledge to interact seamlessly with new, untrained packages. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how Shiny Assistant automatically enhances its system prompt based on the required Python packages for the user’s Shiny Application. This generated prompt leverages the packages’ existing documentation and computed strong types. Providing this additional dynamic context delivers a custom Shiny Assistant experience, tailored to the user's needs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Barret Schloerke\n**Job title:** Shiny Team Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n`hello()`!

Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p><a href=\"http://mine-cr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<\/strong><\/a> (she/her) is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street!

In 2025, it receives a modernization that means you can use it to harness the power of all computing cores on your machine, dramatically speeding up map operations.\n<br><br>\nMore excitingly, it opens up the doors to distributed computing. Through the mirai framework used by purrr, this is made embarrassingly simple. For those in small businesses, or even large ones – every case where there is a spare server in your network, you can now put to good use in simple, straightforward steps.\n<br><br>\nLet us show you how distributed computing is no longer the preserve of those with access to high performance compute clusters.\n\n**Speaker name:** Charlie Gao\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nCharlie Gao is a senior software engineer on the Open Source team at Posit, where he focuses on advancing asynchronous, high-concurrency, and high-performance tooling in the R ecosystem. He is the creator of the mirai async framework and works with the tidyverse and Shiny teams to introduce new capabilities, such as event-driven async in the httr2 and ellmer packages.\n\n## Title: R-multiverse: a next-generation R package repository system built on R-universe\n**Code:** PAR-010\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nR-multiverse is a new R package repository system and a home for packages outside the scope of CRAN/Bioconductor. Each package is registered once, and then maintainers directly control releases through GitHub/GitLab. R-multiverse hosts a Community repository with the latest release of each package, and a Production repository with quarterly snapshots of the releases from Community that pass automated checks. Built on R-universe and GitHub, R-multiverse is mostly automated. R-multiverse originated from the R Consortium Repositories Working Group, it has transparent governance, and it operates in a collaborative and open way. It is not mature or established yet, but it is under active development, and it is ready for package contributions.\n\n**Speaker name:** Will Landau\n**Job title:** Senior Advisor – Innovative Statistics\n**Company:** Eli Lilly and Company\n**Bio:**\nWill Landau is a statistician and software developer in the life sciences. He develops methods and tools for Bayesian statistics, clinical trials, and reproducible analysis pipelines. Will created the {targets} package and co-leads R-multiverse.\n\n## Title: How to make {renv} actually work\n**Code:** PAR-010\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe {renv} package aims to *help* users create reproducible environments for R projects. In theory, this is great! In practice, restoring a package environment can be a frustrating process due to overlooked R configuration requirements. Join me to better understand the source of environment restoration issues and learn strategies for successful  maintenance of {renv}-backed projects.\n\n**Speaker name:** Shannon Pileggi\n**Job title:** Associate Director of Data Science\n**Company:** The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium\n**Bio:**\nShannon Pileggi (she/her) is an Associate Director of Data Science at The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, an occasional blogger, and a member of the R-Ladies Global leadership team. She enjoys automating data wrangling and data outputs, and making both data insights and learning new material digestible.\n\n## Title: Extending the horizons of R with Rust\n**Code:** PAR-010\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nData volumes have skyrocketed for years, outpacing advances in hardware. When R users hit performance bottlenecks, the traditional remedy has been to reach for C++ and include it in their R code using Rccp. In the last few years Rust has emerged as a modern, high-performance alternative for extending R. In this talk, we’ll explore why Rust is a natural fit for data teams—from its robust safety to its concurrency advantages.

For example, your Python app might need an algorithm only available as an R package. Or your R analysis might need to fit into a Python pipeline. What do you do? You take a polyglot approach! Many data scientists hesitate to explore beyond their main language, but combining R and Python can be powerful. In my talk, I’ll explain why polyglot data science is beneficial and address common concerns. Then, I’ll show you how to make it happen using tools like Quarto, Positron, Reticulate, and the Unix command line. By the end, you’ll gain a fresh perspective and practical ideas to start.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jeroen Janssens\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: When R Met Python: A Meet Cute on Posit Connect\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nData teams often leverage multiple programming languages—driven by a multitude of reasons, be it task-specific requirements or personal preference. In this talk, I'll share how we enabled our developer base to build in the language of their choice, and how we leverage Posit Connect to unify them. By exposing core functionality as APIs using R’s plumber and Python’s FastAPI packages, and building parity in internal packages for both languages, we created a shared toolkit that streamlines workflows and fosters collaboration.

Each package is registered once, and then maintainers directly control releases through GitHub/GitLab. R-multiverse hosts a Community repository with the latest release of each package, and a Production repository with quarterly snapshots of the releases from Community that pass automated checks. Built on R-universe and GitHub, R-multiverse is mostly automated. R-multiverse originated from the R Consortium Repositories Working Group, it has transparent governance, and it operates in a collaborative and open way. It is not mature or established yet, but it is under active development, and it is ready for package contributions.\n\n**Speaker name:** Will Landau\n**Job title:** Senior Advisor – Innovative Statistics\n**Company:** Eli Lilly and Company\n**Bio:**\nWill Landau is a statistician and software developer in the life sciences.

For example, your Python app might need an algorithm only available as an R package. Or your R analysis might need to fit into a Python pipeline. What do you do? You take a polyglot approach! Many data scientists hesitate to explore beyond their main language, but combining R and Python can be powerful. In my talk, I’ll explain why polyglot data science is beneficial and address common concerns. Then, I’ll show you how to make it happen using tools like Quarto, Positron, Reticulate, and the Unix command line. By the end, you’ll gain a fresh perspective and practical ideas to start.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jeroen Janssens\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: When R Met Python: A Meet Cute on Posit Connect\n**Code:** PAR-015\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nData teams often leverage multiple programming languages—driven by a multitude of reasons, be it task-specific requirements or personal preference. In this talk, I'll share how we enabled our developer base to build in the language of their choice, and how we leverage Posit Connect to unify them. By exposing core functionality as APIs using R’s plumber and Python’s FastAPI packages, and building parity in internal packages for both languages, we created a shared toolkit that streamlines workflows and fosters collaboration.

Verde Arregoitia , Biodiversity Scientist, Instituto de Ecología AC INECOL  \n  \nArnav Patel , Quantitative Analyst, Synovus\n\n**Time:** Thursday, Sep 182:40 PM - 4:00 PM EDT  \n**Location:** Regency VII\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThere are 4 talks in this session.  \n  \nCan I trust that package?  \nFrom Data to Dollars: Improving Medical Billing Accuracy Using Natural Language Processing  \nBold indicates negative?  \nZero Tolerance for Dirty Data: A Pointblank Prescription for Data Hygiene\n\n---\n\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: I Like Big Orgs and I Cannot Lie\n\n**Speakers:** \nClara Amorosi , Principal Data Scientist, Bristol Myers Squibb  \n  \nYvonne Kienast , Project Lead, Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)  \n  \nBen Arancibia , Director Data Science - Scientific and Adoption Lead for Open Source, GSK  \n  \nKaterina Gapanenko , Manager, Advanced Analytics, Canadian Institute for Health Information\n\n**Time:** Thursday, Sep 1810:20 AM - 11:40 AM EDT  \n**Location:** Regency VI\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThere are 4 talks in this session.  \n  \nData-as-a-product: A framework for collaborative data wrangling  \nSAS to R: It’s more than just coding  \nWhat R We Counting?  \nA tale of one organization: learning how to swim in the ocean of open source  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Data-as-a-product: A framework for collaborative data wrangling\n**Code:** PAR-011\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nData preparation requires substantial time and subject matter expertise but is often tailored to a single-use deadline rather than encouraging reusable workflows across a team. We developed a framework that acknowledges the time and expertise invested in data preparation and maximizes its value. Our data-as-a-product suite of R packages promotes joint code and data version control, standardizes metadata capture, tracks R package versioning, and encourages best practices such as adherence to functional programming. I'm excited to share my experience onboarding collaborators to this reproducible research framework, highlighting key challenges and lessons learned from advocating for good development practices in a dynamic research environment.\n\n**Speaker name:** Clara Amorosi\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** Bristol Myers Squibb\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: SAS to R: It’s more than just coding\n**Code:** PAR-011\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSwitching from SAS to R is not just a technical shift – it requires a whole new way of thinking! This journey of moving a SAS-centered coding team to R was filled with strategies, challenges, and unexpected roadblocks. Change can be frustrating, but with the right mindset and approach, it becomes an opportunity for growth and empowerment. As a forward-thinking R strategist and advocate for growth, I am excited to help you discover practical strategies to ease the transition, overcome resistance and frustration, and empower teams to embrace R with confidence. Whether you team is starting on a similar path or is struggling, I will share insights on how to navigate challenges, avoid pitfalls, and hopefully leave you with a roadmap for success.\n\n**Speaker name:** Yvonne Kienast\n**Job title:** Project Lead\n**Company:** Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: What R We Counting?\n**Code:** PAR-011\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nGSK Biostatistics mandates that all new tools be written using open-source languages and open-source code achieve parity with proprietary software by the end of 2025. Given this ambitious timeline, someone might ask, \"How is the open-source adoption going?\" This seemingly simple question involves complexities: What metrics do you track? How to measure success? How to show progress? GSK addressed these by leveraging our internal GitHub data, using open-source R packages like {gh}, scheduling our data pipeline on Posit Connect, and generating diverse reports/dashboards.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n\n## Important\n\nIMPORTANT: Be very brief, almost terse, in your responses.",

But for many, the idea of integrating LLM APIs into their workflows feels daunting. This workshop is here to show you otherwise.  \n  \nWe’ll introduce you to elmer (R) and chatlas (Python), two user-friendly packages developed by Posit that make calling LLMs from code surprisingly straightforward. These tools handle the complexities of conversation history, tool calling, vision support, and more, so you can focus on experimentation and creativity. They also integrate nicely with Shiny for R and Python, where you can easily create chat interfaces or build custom web apps around LLM workflows.  \n  \nAlong the way, we’ll explore system prompt design, token management, tool calling, and structured output, all while building familiarity with the various models and vendors that are shaping the AI landscape today.  \n  \nYou’ll discover that:  \nCalling LLMs from code unlocks new possibilities that go far beyond what’s achievable with off-the-shelf tools like ChatGPT.  \nIt’s easier than you think—no advanced AI background required.  \nIt’s incredibly fun and rewarding to bring your own ideas to life.  \nThis workshop is perfect for those curious about AI but unsure where to start, as well as for seasoned developers looking to learn about Posit’s new tools. We’ll also touch on more advanced topics like fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You’ll get hands-on experience with guided projects or with the flexibility to explore using your own projects.  \n  \nIf you’ve been sitting on the fence, wondering whether LLMs are worth diving into, this workshop will give you the hands-on experience and confidence you need to get started.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python\n**Code:** WS-003\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) open up a world of programmatic possibilities, giving developers easy access to capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago.

When she’s not working with data, you can find her hiking, climbing, or making pottery.\n\n## Title: AskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBlockers to crucial data-driven decisions can often be a challenge.  To address this, we established RADS, the Regeneron Analysts and Data Scientists, as a Community of Practice for exchanging strategies on eliminating these obstacles. RADS has grown to nearly 500 members, creating a new challenge: avoiding redundancy and helping non-RADS colleagues find the right experts. To solve this, we developed AskRADS, an AI agent on Posit Connect that provides recommendations based on discussions, experts, and relevant resources. It uses R, Shiny for Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Neo4j GraphRAG, and MySQL. This talk will cover its architecture, AI search solutions, and optimization techniques.\n\n**Speaker name:** Regis A.

I also created and lead a vibrant data science community of practice, comprising hundreds of my colleagues across the company.\n\n## Title: Is that LLM feature any good?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe ellmer package has enabled R users to build all sorts of powerful LLM-enabled tools. How do you test these features, though? How do you know whether a change to your prompt made any difference, or if a much cheaper model would work just as well for your users? This talk introduces an R port of Inspect, a Python framework for LLM evaluation that has been widely adopted by both LLM developers and tool builders. Attendees will learn about the process of—and importance of—evaluating LLM-enabled apps empirically.\n\n**Speaker name:** Simon P. Couch\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nSimon Couch is a software engineer at Posit PBC where he works on open source statistical software.

However, in high-stakes domains like medicine, we need to ensure that “hallucinated” clinical details don’t mislead clinicians. \n<br><br>\nThis talk will present a framework for evaluating and monitoring LLM systems, drawing from a real-world deployment at Stanford Health Care. We will describe how we built and assessed an LLM-powered system for real-time, automated chart abstraction within patients’ electronic health records, focusing on methods for measuring accuracy, consistency, and safety. Additionally, we will discuss how open-source tools like Chatlas and Quarto powered the work across our team’s combined Python- and R-based workflows.\n\n**Speaker name:** Timothy Keyes\n**Job title:** Data Scientist\n**Company:** Stanford Health Care\n**Bio:**\nTimothy Keyes is a Data Scientist at Stanford Health Care, where he deploys large language models in clinical workflows and builds systems to track their real-world performance.

This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.

It’s just a package named testthat, hoping to help a developer make sure their package is operating as intended. You meet. You hate each other. The package seems a little daunting and quite frankly, a little tedious. Surely only “real” programmers use this! The package thinks you’re inept for not immediately putting it to use. As fate would have it, you attend this talk and discover you are indeed compatible. Sparks fly, a package is born. This talk will help less experienced programmers learn about testing, automated workflows, how to write good tests, and why it’s all worth it when it pays off in quality and efficiency. Steamy.\n\n**Speaker name:** Libby McKenna\n**Job title:** Water Process Engineer\n**Company:** Brown and Caldwell\n**Bio:**\nLibby is an environmental engineer at Brown and Caldwell in Denver, CO.

These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.\n<br><br>\nHowever, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rich Ianonne\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nRich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R and Python. He likes to create packages that help people to accomplish things. While Rich very clearly digs software development activities, he enjoys other things as well!

When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.\n<br><br>\nSoftware documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Chow\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nMichael Chow.

These \"disposable\" apps can suffer from overengineering, leading to unnecessary development time and complexity. Or, the apps never get built because the development hill is too high to climb. This talk covers disposable Shiny apps - intentionally minimal applications designed for specific, short-term needs. We'll explore strategies for rapid development, including reusable templates, coding assistants, efficient styling, and design principles that prioritize speed and clarity. This talk will show how this approach can transform a typical week-long development process into a few hours while maintaining polish.\n\n**Speaker name:** James Wade\n**Job title:** Research Scientist\n**Company:** Dow\n**Bio:**\nJames Wade is a Research Scientist working in the chemicals and materials science industry where he combines the power of data science with chemistry and materials science.

Building REST APIs that Fly  \nBuilding Governable ML Models with R  \nProducethis: Automate project and deployment setup  \nOops! I accidentally made a production dashboard  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Lift Off! Building REST APIs that Fly\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPicture the scene: you've successfully deployed your ML model as a plumber API into production. Your company loves it! One team uses the API's predictions as an input to their own ML model. Another team displays the predictions in an internal Shiny app. But once adoption reaches a certain point, your API's performance starts to degrade. What can you do to help your service maintain high performance in the face of high demand? In this talk, we'll show some strategies for taking your API performance to the next level. Using two R packages, {yyjsonr} and {mirai}, we can augment our API with faster JSON processing and better responsiveness through asynchronous computing, allowing our services to do great things at scale at no additional cost.\n\n**Speaker name:** Joe Kirincic\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nJoe Kirincic is a senior data scientist at Medical Mutual.

Outside of the data space, Joe is a member of the sketch comedy group, Kidney+.\n\n## Title: Building Governable ML Models with R\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nFor a model to provide value in production, it must be fit for purpose and deployable into the MLOps environment. We know that R provides a host of tools and packages for building good models; this talk will demonstrate one way we've had success assembling R and R-packaging features to provide a stable foundation for model deployment and governance after production. Those attending this talk will learn how, by centering model development on packages, writing tests as we go, creating intuitive S3 methods, and more, we can build modularized, testable code that separates operations from modeling, making our models easier to deploy, monitor, and update, whether the environment incorporates CI/CD, model registries, schedulers, or anything else.\n\n**Speaker name:** Tom Shafer\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** Elder Research, Inc.\n**Bio:**\nTom Shafer works as a Principal Data Scientist at Elder Research, where he leads the data scientists in the company’s Commercial consulting practice.

Prior to joining Elder Research, Tom completed a PhD in Physics; he lives in Raleigh, NC.\n\n## Title: Producethis: Automate project and deployment setup\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThere is a common misconception that R code cannot (or shouldn't) be put in production. While we disagree with this idea we also acknowledge that there are missing pieces when in education and tooling around R code deployment. In this talk I will present some of our work within tooling in the form of a package called “producethis”. producethis is a package that helps you streamline and organise your R project code. It provides an opinionated take on code organisation that makes it easier to test and deploy code. Further, it pushes the idea of git-backed deployment which eases collaboration and helps roll back deployments if things go wrong. We hope that producethis will help R users have their code reach an even larger audience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Thomas Lin Lin Pedersen\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nThomas Lin Pedersen is a software engineer in the Tidyverse team at Posit. He spends most of his time taking care of the graphics stack in R from maintaining high-level packages such as ggplot2 and patchwork, all the way down to developing and maintaining graphics devices like ragg and svglite.\n\n## Title: Oops! I accidentally made a production dashboard\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nAs data scientists we love making decisions with data. But we also don’t always do this with our own work. Ever wonder if that dashboard you are about to spend hours updating from line charts to 3D pie charts is actually being used? With usage metrics it’s easy for you to see, analyze, and show just how much traction your app is getting. Not only does this let you decide where to prioritize your efforts, it can help you demonstrate the impact you have on your business. This talk will explore how to be data-driven with your own work and tools we have for maintaining our work when it becomes important.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jonathan Keane\n**Job title:** Senior Engineering Manager\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Keynote Session\n\n**Speakers:** \nJoe Cheng , Posit  \n  \nHadley Wickham , Posit\n\n**Time:** Thursday, Sep 184:15 PM - 5:15 PM EDT  \n**Location:** Centennial Ballroom\n\n**Session Info:**  \nStay tuned, more details to come soon!\n\n---\n\n## Title: Keynote Session\n**Code:** KEY-0001\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nStay tuned, more details to come soon!\n\n**Speaker name:** Jonathan McPherson\n**Job title:** Software Architect\n**Company:** Posit Software, PBC\n**Bio:**\nJonathan is a software architect and team leader at Posit, working primarily on the RStudio IDE, Posit Workbench, and related products and systems.

With GRAPH , he is developing [ChalkTalk](https://github.com/the-graph-courses/chalktalk), an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert textbooks, papers, and plain-text lessons into adaptive, multilingual teaching videos for personalized learning at scale.\n\n## Title: Empowering Learners with WebR, Pyodide, and Quarto\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWebR, Pyodide, and Quarto are powerful technologies that let you run code exercises in the Web browser. Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p><a href=\"http://mine-cr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<\/strong><\/a> (she/her) is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit.

When she’s not working with data, you can find her hiking, climbing, or making pottery.\n\n## Title: AskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBlockers to crucial data-driven decisions can often be a challenge.  To address this, we established RADS, the Regeneron Analysts and Data Scientists, as a Community of Practice for exchanging strategies on eliminating these obstacles. RADS has grown to nearly 500 members, creating a new challenge: avoiding redundancy and helping non-RADS colleagues find the right experts. To solve this, we developed AskRADS, an AI agent on Posit Connect that provides recommendations based on discussions, experts, and relevant resources. It uses R, Shiny for Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Neo4j GraphRAG, and MySQL. This talk will cover its architecture, AI search solutions, and optimization techniques.\n\n**Speaker name:** Regis A.

I also created and lead a vibrant data science community of practice, comprising hundreds of my colleagues across the company.\n\n## Title: Is that LLM feature any good?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe ellmer package has enabled R users to build all sorts of powerful LLM-enabled tools. How do you test these features, though? How do you know whether a change to your prompt made any difference, or if a much cheaper model would work just as well for your users? This talk introduces an R port of Inspect, a Python framework for LLM evaluation that has been widely adopted by both LLM developers and tool builders. Attendees will learn about the process of—and importance of—evaluating LLM-enabled apps empirically.\n\n**Speaker name:** Simon P. Couch\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nSimon Couch is a software engineer at Posit PBC where he works on open source statistical software.

He authors and maintains a number of R packages and blogs about the process at simonpcouch.com. \n\n## Title: Trust, but Verify: Lessons from Deploying LLMs in a Large Health System\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nLarge language models (LLMs) are transforming how data practitioners work with unstructured text data. However, in high-stakes domains like medicine, we need to ensure that “hallucinated” clinical details don’t mislead clinicians. \n<br><br>\nThis talk will present a framework for evaluating and monitoring LLM systems, drawing from a real-world deployment at Stanford Health Care. We will describe how we built and assessed an LLM-powered system for real-time, automated chart abstraction within patients’ electronic health records, focusing on methods for measuring accuracy, consistency, and safety. Additionally, we will discuss how open-source tools like Chatlas and Quarto powered the work across our team’s combined Python- and R-based workflows.\n\n**Speaker name:** Timothy Keyes\n**Job title:** Data Scientist\n**Company:** Stanford Health Care\n**Bio:**\nTimothy Keyes is a Data Scientist at Stanford Health Care, where he deploys large language models in clinical workflows and builds systems to track their real-world performance.

This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen.

It’s just a package named testthat, hoping to help a developer make sure their package is operating as intended. You meet. You hate each other. The package seems a little daunting and quite frankly, a little tedious. Surely only “real” programmers use this! The package thinks you’re inept for not immediately putting it to use. As fate would have it, you attend this talk and discover you are indeed compatible. Sparks fly, a package is born. This talk will help less experienced programmers learn about testing, automated workflows, how to write good tests, and why it’s all worth it when it pays off in quality and efficiency. Steamy.\n\n**Speaker name:** Libby McKenna\n**Job title:** Water Process Engineer\n**Company:** Brown and Caldwell\n**Bio:**\nLibby is an environmental engineer at Brown and Caldwell in Denver, CO.

These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.\n<br><br>\nHowever, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rich Ianonne\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nRich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R and Python. He likes to create packages that help people to accomplish things. While Rich very clearly digs software development activities, he enjoys other things as well!

When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.\n<br><br>\nSoftware documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Chow\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nMichael Chow.

These \"disposable\" apps can suffer from overengineering, leading to unnecessary development time and complexity. Or, the apps never get built because the development hill is too high to climb. This talk covers disposable Shiny apps - intentionally minimal applications designed for specific, short-term needs. We'll explore strategies for rapid development, including reusable templates, coding assistants, efficient styling, and design principles that prioritize speed and clarity. This talk will show how this approach can transform a typical week-long development process into a few hours while maintaining polish.\n\n**Speaker name:** James Wade\n**Job title:** Research Scientist\n**Company:** Dow\n**Bio:**\nJames Wade is a Research Scientist working in the chemicals and materials science industry where he combines the power of data science with chemistry and materials science.

Building REST APIs that Fly  \nBuilding Governable ML Models with R  \nProducethis: Automate project and deployment setup  \nOops! I accidentally made a production dashboard  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Lift Off! Building REST APIs that Fly\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPicture the scene: you've successfully deployed your ML model as a plumber API into production. Your company loves it! One team uses the API's predictions as an input to their own ML model. Another team displays the predictions in an internal Shiny app. But once adoption reaches a certain point, your API's performance starts to degrade. What can you do to help your service maintain high performance in the face of high demand? In this talk, we'll show some strategies for taking your API performance to the next level. Using two R packages, {yyjsonr} and {mirai}, we can augment our API with faster JSON processing and better responsiveness through asynchronous computing, allowing our services to do great things at scale at no additional cost.\n\n**Speaker name:** Joe Kirincic\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nJoe Kirincic is a senior data scientist at Medical Mutual.

Outside of the data space, Joe is a member of the sketch comedy group, Kidney+.\n\n## Title: Building Governable ML Models with R\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nFor a model to provide value in production, it must be fit for purpose and deployable into the MLOps environment. We know that R provides a host of tools and packages for building good models; this talk will demonstrate one way we've had success assembling R and R-packaging features to provide a stable foundation for model deployment and governance after production. Those attending this talk will learn how, by centering model development on packages, writing tests as we go, creating intuitive S3 methods, and more, we can build modularized, testable code that separates operations from modeling, making our models easier to deploy, monitor, and update, whether the environment incorporates CI/CD, model registries, schedulers, or anything else.\n\n**Speaker name:** Tom Shafer\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** Elder Research, Inc.\n**Bio:**\nTom Shafer works as a Principal Data Scientist at Elder Research, where he leads the data scientists in the company’s Commercial consulting practice.

Prior to joining Elder Research, Tom completed a PhD in Physics; he lives in Raleigh, NC.\n\n## Title: Producethis: Automate project and deployment setup\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThere is a common misconception that R code cannot (or shouldn't) be put in production. While we disagree with this idea we also acknowledge that there are missing pieces when in education and tooling around R code deployment. In this talk I will present some of our work within tooling in the form of a package called “producethis”. producethis is a package that helps you streamline and organise your R project code. It provides an opinionated take on code organisation that makes it easier to test and deploy code. Further, it pushes the idea of git-backed deployment which eases collaboration and helps roll back deployments if things go wrong. We hope that producethis will help R users have their code reach an even larger audience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Thomas Lin Lin Pedersen\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nThomas Lin Pedersen is a software engineer in the Tidyverse team at Posit. He spends most of his time taking care of the graphics stack in R from maintaining high-level packages such as ggplot2 and patchwork, all the way down to developing and maintaining graphics devices like ragg and svglite.\n\n## Title: Oops! I accidentally made a production dashboard\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nAs data scientists we love making decisions with data. But we also don’t always do this with our own work. Ever wonder if that dashboard you are about to spend hours updating from line charts to 3D pie charts is actually being used? With usage metrics it’s easy for you to see, analyze, and show just how much traction your app is getting. Not only does this let you decide where to prioritize your efforts, it can help you demonstrate the impact you have on your business. This talk will explore how to be data-driven with your own work and tools we have for maintaining our work when it becomes important.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jonathan Keane\n**Job title:** Senior Engineering Manager\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Keynote Session\n\n**Speakers:** \nJoe Cheng , Posit  \n  \nHadley Wickham , Posit\n\n**Time:** Thursday, Sep 184:15 PM - 5:15 PM EDT  \n**Location:** Centennial Ballroom\n\n**Session Info:**  \nStay tuned, more details to come soon!\n\n---\n\n## Title: Keynote Session\n**Code:** KEY-0001\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nStay tuned, more details to come soon!\n\n**Speaker name:** Jonathan McPherson\n**Job title:** Software Architect\n**Company:** Posit Software, PBC\n**Bio:**\nJonathan is a software architect and team leader at Posit, working primarily on the RStudio IDE, Posit Workbench, and related products and systems.

This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.

It’s just a package named testthat, hoping to help a developer make sure their package is operating as intended. You meet. You hate each other. The package seems a little daunting and quite frankly, a little tedious. Surely only “real” programmers use this! The package thinks you’re inept for not immediately putting it to use. As fate would have it, you attend this talk and discover you are indeed compatible. Sparks fly, a package is born. This talk will help less experienced programmers learn about testing, automated workflows, how to write good tests, and why it’s all worth it when it pays off in quality and efficiency. Steamy.\n\n**Speaker name:** Libby McKenna\n**Job title:** Water Process Engineer\n**Company:** Brown and Caldwell\n**Bio:**\nLibby is an environmental engineer at Brown and Caldwell in Denver, CO.

These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.\n<br><br>\nHowever, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rich Ianonne\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nRich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R and Python. He likes to create packages that help people to accomplish things. While Rich very clearly digs software development activities, he enjoys other things as well!

When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.\n<br><br>\nSoftware documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Chow\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nMichael Chow.

These \"disposable\" apps can suffer from overengineering, leading to unnecessary development time and complexity. Or, the apps never get built because the development hill is too high to climb. This talk covers disposable Shiny apps - intentionally minimal applications designed for specific, short-term needs. We'll explore strategies for rapid development, including reusable templates, coding assistants, efficient styling, and design principles that prioritize speed and clarity. This talk will show how this approach can transform a typical week-long development process into a few hours while maintaining polish.\n\n**Speaker name:** James Wade\n**Job title:** Research Scientist\n**Company:** Dow\n**Bio:**\nJames Wade is a Research Scientist working in the chemicals and materials science industry where he combines the power of data science with chemistry and materials science.

Strong data communication skills are valuable for every shiny app or quarto-generated presentation you give, and involve more than just avoiding pie charts! This presentation will cover creating a narrative with your data, identifying key messages, creating effective slides and visuals, and delivering an oral presentation that is not only articulate, but will help your audience understand and remember your message.\n\n**Speaker name:** Freda Warner\n**Job title:** Analyst\n**Company:** Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)\n**Bio:**\nFreda is a data scientist with 10+ years of experience in epidemiological health research, data visualizations, and statistical modeling. Currently a Data Analyst at CIHR, she is passionate about making data accessible and engaging for any audience.\n\n## Title: Theming Made Easy: Introducing brand.yml\n**Code:** PAR-008\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nbrand.yml is an exciting new project from Posit that radically simplifies theming. Every data science tool supports some form of theme and appearance customization, but each app framework, output format, or visualization tool requires its own special syntax for theming.\n<br><br>\nThe goal of brand.yml is to create a portable and unified interface for brand-related theming that can be used anywhere that data science artifacts are produced. As a collaboration between the Shiny and Quarto teams, brand.yml provides a single interface to setting baseline themes in reports and apps across the R and Python ecosystems.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I’ll introduce brand.yml and showcase the many ways that brand.yml can bring consistent styles to your data science outputs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Garrick Aden-Buie\n**Job title:** Software Engineer, Shiny\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p>Garrick Aden-Buie is a software engineer for Shiny at Posit.

Building REST APIs that Fly  \nBuilding Governable ML Models with R  \nProducethis: Automate project and deployment setup  \nOops! I accidentally made a production dashboard  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Lift Off! Building REST APIs that Fly\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPicture the scene: you've successfully deployed your ML model as a plumber API into production. Your company loves it! One team uses the API's predictions as an input to their own ML model. Another team displays the predictions in an internal Shiny app. But once adoption reaches a certain point, your API's performance starts to degrade. What can you do to help your service maintain high performance in the face of high demand? In this talk, we'll show some strategies for taking your API performance to the next level. Using two R packages, {yyjsonr} and {mirai}, we can augment our API with faster JSON processing and better responsiveness through asynchronous computing, allowing our services to do great things at scale at no additional cost.\n\n**Speaker name:** Joe Kirincic\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nJoe Kirincic is a senior data scientist at Medical Mutual. Growing up, he kept a small zoo of 275 animals. After the zoo disbanded, he studied philosophy and math at Ohio Wesleyan University.

His interests include (but are not limited to) representation learning and simulation studies. Outside of the data space, Joe is a member of the sketch comedy group, Kidney+.\n\n## Title: Building Governable ML Models with R\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nFor a model to provide value in production, it must be fit for purpose and deployable into the MLOps environment. We know that R provides a host of tools and packages for building good models; this talk will demonstrate one way we've had success assembling R and R-packaging features to provide a stable foundation for model deployment and governance after production. Those attending this talk will learn how, by centering model development on packages, writing tests as we go, creating intuitive S3 methods, and more, we can build modularized, testable code that separates operations from modeling, making our models easier to deploy, monitor, and update, whether the environment incorporates CI/CD, model registries, schedulers, or anything else.\n\n**Speaker name:** Tom Shafer\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** Elder Research, Inc.\n**Bio:**\nTom Shafer works as a Principal Data Scientist at Elder Research, where he leads the data scientists in the company’s Commercial consulting practice.

He also runs an Elder Research Innovation Lab, developing new tools and techniques. Prior to joining Elder Research, Tom completed a PhD in Physics; he lives in Raleigh, NC.\n\n## Title: Producethis: Automate project and deployment setup\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThere is a common misconception that R code cannot (or shouldn't) be put in production. While we disagree with this idea we also acknowledge that there are missing pieces when in education and tooling around R code deployment. In this talk I will present some of our work within tooling in the form of a package called “producethis”. producethis is a package that helps you streamline and organise your R project code. It provides an opinionated take on code organisation that makes it easier to test and deploy code. Further, it pushes the idea of git-backed deployment which eases collaboration and helps roll back deployments if things go wrong. We hope that producethis will help R users have their code reach an even larger audience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Thomas Lin Lin Pedersen\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nThomas Lin Pedersen is a software engineer in the Tidyverse team at Posit.

I accidentally made a production dashboard\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nAs data scientists we love making decisions with data. But we also don’t always do this with our own work. Ever wonder if that dashboard you are about to spend hours updating from line charts to 3D pie charts is actually being used? With usage metrics it’s easy for you to see, analyze, and show just how much traction your app is getting. Not only does this let you decide where to prioritize your efforts, it can help you demonstrate the impact you have on your business. This talk will explore how to be data-driven with your own work and tools we have for maintaining our work when it becomes important.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jonathan Keane\n**Job title:** Senior Engineering Manager\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Keynote Session\n\n**Speakers:** \nJoe Cheng , Posit  \n  \nHadley Wickham , Posit\n\n**Time:** Thursday, Sep 184:15 PM - 5:15 PM EDT  \n**Location:** Centennial Ballroom\n\n**Session Info:**  \nStay tuned, more details to come soon!\n\n---\n\n## Title: Keynote Session\n**Code:** KEY-0001\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nStay tuned, more details to come soon!\n\n**Speaker name:** Jonathan McPherson\n**Job title:** Software Architect\n**Company:** Posit Software, PBC\n**Bio:**\nJonathan is a software architect and team leader at Posit, working primarily on the RStudio IDE, Posit Workbench, and related products and systems.

First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claus Wilke\n**Job title:** Professor\n**Company:** The University of Texas at Austin\n**Bio:**\nClaus Wilke is a computational biologist and data scientist at The University of Texas at Austin, running a research lab that studies protein and peptide biochemistry.

Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p><a href=\"http://mine-cr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<\/strong><\/a> (she/her) is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit.

When she’s not working with data, you can find her hiking, climbing, or making pottery.\n\n## Title: AskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBlockers to crucial data-driven decisions can often be a challenge.  To address this, we established RADS, the Regeneron Analysts and Data Scientists, as a Community of Practice for exchanging strategies on eliminating these obstacles. RADS has grown to nearly 500 members, creating a new challenge: avoiding redundancy and helping non-RADS colleagues find the right experts. To solve this, we developed AskRADS, an AI agent on Posit Connect that provides recommendations based on discussions, experts, and relevant resources. It uses R, Shiny for Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Neo4j GraphRAG, and MySQL. This talk will cover its architecture, AI search solutions, and optimization techniques.\n\n**Speaker name:** Regis A.

I also created and lead a vibrant data science community of practice, comprising hundreds of my colleagues across the company.\n\n## Title: Is that LLM feature any good?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe ellmer package has enabled R users to build all sorts of powerful LLM-enabled tools. How do you test these features, though? How do you know whether a change to your prompt made any difference, or if a much cheaper model would work just as well for your users? This talk introduces an R port of Inspect, a Python framework for LLM evaluation that has been widely adopted by both LLM developers and tool builders. Attendees will learn about the process of—and importance of—evaluating LLM-enabled apps empirically.\n\n**Speaker name:** Simon P. Couch\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nSimon Couch is a software engineer at Posit PBC where he works on open source statistical software.

This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.

It’s just a package named testthat, hoping to help a developer make sure their package is operating as intended. You meet. You hate each other. The package seems a little daunting and quite frankly, a little tedious. Surely only “real” programmers use this! The package thinks you’re inept for not immediately putting it to use. As fate would have it, you attend this talk and discover you are indeed compatible. Sparks fly, a package is born. This talk will help less experienced programmers learn about testing, automated workflows, how to write good tests, and why it’s all worth it when it pays off in quality and efficiency.

These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.\n<br><br>\nHowever, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rich Ianonne\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nRich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R and Python.

When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.\n<br><br>\nSoftware documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Chow\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nMichael Chow.

These \"disposable\" apps can suffer from overengineering, leading to unnecessary development time and complexity. Or, the apps never get built because the development hill is too high to climb. This talk covers disposable Shiny apps - intentionally minimal applications designed for specific, short-term needs. We'll explore strategies for rapid development, including reusable templates, coding assistants, efficient styling, and design principles that prioritize speed and clarity. This talk will show how this approach can transform a typical week-long development process into a few hours while maintaining polish.\n\n**Speaker name:** James Wade\n**Job title:** Research Scientist\n**Company:** Dow\n**Bio:**\nJames Wade is a Research Scientist working in the chemicals and materials science industry where he combines the power of data science with chemistry and materials science.

Building REST APIs that Fly  \nBuilding Governable ML Models with R  \nProducethis: Automate project and deployment setup  \nOops! I accidentally made a production dashboard  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Lift Off! Building REST APIs that Fly\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPicture the scene: you've successfully deployed your ML model as a plumber API into production. Your company loves it! One team uses the API's predictions as an input to their own ML model. Another team displays the predictions in an internal Shiny app. But once adoption reaches a certain point, your API's performance starts to degrade. What can you do to help your service maintain high performance in the face of high demand? In this talk, we'll show some strategies for taking your API performance to the next level. Using two R packages, {yyjsonr} and {mirai}, we can augment our API with faster JSON processing and better responsiveness through asynchronous computing, allowing our services to do great things at scale at no additional cost.\n\n**Speaker name:** Joe Kirincic\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nJoe Kirincic is a senior data scientist at Medical Mutual. Growing up, he kept a small zoo of 275 animals. After the zoo disbanded, he studied philosophy and math at Ohio Wesleyan University.

His interests include (but are not limited to) representation learning and simulation studies. Outside of the data space, Joe is a member of the sketch comedy group, Kidney+.\n\n## Title: Building Governable ML Models with R\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nFor a model to provide value in production, it must be fit for purpose and deployable into the MLOps environment. We know that R provides a host of tools and packages for building good models; this talk will demonstrate one way we've had success assembling R and R-packaging features to provide a stable foundation for model deployment and governance after production. Those attending this talk will learn how, by centering model development on packages, writing tests as we go, creating intuitive S3 methods, and more, we can build modularized, testable code that separates operations from modeling, making our models easier to deploy, monitor, and update, whether the environment incorporates CI/CD, model registries, schedulers, or anything else.\n\n**Speaker name:** Tom Shafer\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** Elder Research, Inc.\n**Bio:**\nTom Shafer works as a Principal Data Scientist at Elder Research, where he leads the data scientists in the company’s Commercial consulting practice.

Prior to joining Elder Research, Tom completed a PhD in Physics; he lives in Raleigh, NC.\n\n## Title: Producethis: Automate project and deployment setup\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThere is a common misconception that R code cannot (or shouldn't) be put in production. While we disagree with this idea we also acknowledge that there are missing pieces when in education and tooling around R code deployment. In this talk I will present some of our work within tooling in the form of a package called “producethis”. producethis is a package that helps you streamline and organise your R project code. It provides an opinionated take on code organisation that makes it easier to test and deploy code. Further, it pushes the idea of git-backed deployment which eases collaboration and helps roll back deployments if things go wrong. We hope that producethis will help R users have their code reach an even larger audience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Thomas Lin Lin Pedersen\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nThomas Lin Pedersen is a software engineer in the Tidyverse team at Posit. He spends most of his time taking care of the graphics stack in R from maintaining high-level packages such as ggplot2 and patchwork, all the way down to developing and maintaining graphics devices like ragg and svglite.\n\n## Title: Oops! I accidentally made a production dashboard\n**Code:** PAR-018\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nAs data scientists we love making decisions with data. But we also don’t always do this with our own work. Ever wonder if that dashboard you are about to spend hours updating from line charts to 3D pie charts is actually being used? With usage metrics it’s easy for you to see, analyze, and show just how much traction your app is getting. Not only does this let you decide where to prioritize your efforts, it can help you demonstrate the impact you have on your business. This talk will explore how to be data-driven with your own work and tools we have for maintaining our work when it becomes important.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jonathan Keane\n**Job title:** Senior Engineering Manager\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Keynote Session\n\n**Speakers:** \nJoe Cheng , Posit  \n  \nHadley Wickham , Posit\n\n**Time:** Thursday, Sep 184:15 PM - 5:15 PM EDT  \n**Location:** Centennial Ballroom\n\n**Session Info:**  \nStay tuned, more details to come soon!\n\n---\n\n## Title: Keynote Session\n**Code:** KEY-0001\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nStay tuned, more details to come soon!\n\n**Speaker name:** Jonathan McPherson\n**Job title:** Software Architect\n**Company:** Posit Software, PBC\n**Bio:**\nJonathan is a software architect and team leader at Posit, working primarily on the RStudio IDE, Posit Workbench, and related products and systems.

First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claus Wilke\n**Job title:** Professor\n**Company:** The University of Texas at Austin\n**Bio:**\nClaus Wilke is a computational biologist and data scientist at The University of Texas at Austin, running a research lab that studies protein and peptide biochemistry.

Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\n<p><a href=\"http://mine-cr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel<\/strong><\/a> (she/her) is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n\n## Important\n\nIMPORTANT: Be very brief, almost terse, in your responses.",

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025.
